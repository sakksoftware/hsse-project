JOUR	[BLANK]	Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in Canada	Boothe K	2016	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	16	[EndPage]	Health Reform Observer		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	4	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	Canada adopted guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals in 1994, and a central process for drug assessment in 2003. The context and the way the issue reached the agenda in the two time periods differed. The guidelines were adopted amidst growing academic interest in methods for economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals in Canada and internationally, and were first promoted by an entrepreneur from the pharmaceutical industry. The Common Drug Review (CDR) was adopted in a context of broader intergovernmental negotiations over health reforms, and came onto the agenda as a policy option that addressed pharmaceuticals but avoided the fraught question of public insurance. Both processes aim to harmonize drug assessment in Canada and ensure that publicly reimbursed drugs are cost-effective. Neither is the subject of legislation or regulation, but the CDR enjoys greater uptake as a result of an intergovernmental agreement that all new drugs will be subject to its review. Evaluation of the CDR has been more robust, and finds a split in opinion among stakeholders concerning the CDR’s benefits. This article describes the reforms using information drawn from government and CCOHTA/CADTH documents, published reflections of participants and secondary literature, and nine expert interviews. It finds that although the CDR’s design and implementation respond to some of the shortcomings of the Canadian guidelines, there are still important unresolved tensions between harmonization and transparency in drug assessment, and new challenges regarding pharmaceutical pricing and use of evidence. The way these tensions are resolved has important implications for broader attempts to reform public drug coverage in Canada.	10.13162/hro-ors.v4i1.2796	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/hro-ors/article/view/2796	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Policy innovation is needed to match health care delivery reform: The story of the champlain BASE eConsult service	Liddy CJ, J.  Keely,E.	2015	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	8	[EndPage]	Health Reform Observer		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	3	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	Canada faces an urgent need for innovation and reform of health services delivery (McGinley 2012). In this commentary, we argue that a lack of policy responsiveness can hinder the development and expansion of innovations aiming to improve the quality of patient care. To illustrate these challenges and demonstrate how they can be overcome, we use the case of an innovative electronic consultation service that has grown from a small proofof- concept to a fully implemented regional service, and is currently exploring potential expansion across multiple provinces. We present background information on the service before examining roadblocks it has faced throughout its implementation, and policy changes that would facilitate the creation and expansion of similar services across Canada. As electronic innovations to health care face a unique set of challenges and opportunities, our proposed changes pertain principally to eConsult services and other programs that facilitate electronic communication between providers.	10.13162/hro-ors.v3i2.2747	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	3	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/hro-ors/article/view/2747	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Regulating traditional chinese medicine practitioners and acupuncturists in Ontario, Canada	Randall GEE, M.G.  Barr,N.G.  Vania,D.K.	2015	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	7	[EndPage]	Health Reform Observer		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	3	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	In 2006, the Ontario government passed the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, which granted Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners and Acupuncturists (TCM/A practitioners) self-regulatory status under the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991. The goal of the legislation was to create a new regulatory college that would set and enforce high standards of care and safety in order to enhance public protection and access to a range of traditional and alternative therapies. In April 2013, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario was officially launched. Several factors account for the government’s decision to delegate self-regulatory authority to TCM/A practitioners through the creation of a regulatory college. In particular, the government’s decision seems to have been influenced by lobbying of some practitioners, greater public acceptance of alternative medicines, patient safety concerns related to acupuncture cases in the media, and the precedence of self-regulatory status being granted to these practitioners in other provinces. The degree to which the legislation has achieved its goals is difficult to determine given the short period of time the regulatory college has existed. However, the fact that the college has developed standards of practice to guide TCM/A practitioners and has a process in place to address public complaints is an early indication of movement toward achieving the policy’s goals.     Le gouvernement de l’Ontario a fait voter en 2006 la Loi sur les praticiens en médecine traditionnelle chinoise, qui accorde aux praticiens en médecine traditionnelle chinoise et aux acupuncteurs (praticiens en MTC/A) le statut de profession autonome dans le cadre la Loi sur les professions de la santé réglementées de 1991. Le but de la Loi était de créer un ordre professionnel capable d’établir et appliquer des normes de qualité et de sécurité des soins, ceci dans le but d’améliorer la protection du public et l’accès à un éventail de thérapies traditionnelles et alternatives. L’Ordre des praticiens en médecine traditionnelle chinoise et des acupuncteurs de l’Ontario a été officiellement créé en avril 2013. Cette décision du gouvernement de déléguer l’autorité de la régulation aux praticiens en MTC/A à travers un Ordre peut s’expliquer de plusieurs manières. Entre autres, la décision du gouvernement semble avoir été influencée par la pression exercée par certains groupes de praticiens, l’acceptation croissante par le public des médecines alternatives, des cas de mise en danger de la santé de patients d’acupuncteurs relatés dans la presse, et l’autonomie professionnelle accordée à ces professions dans d’autres provinces. Il est encore trop tôt pour évaluer le succès de cette Loi et de l’Ordre. Cependant, le fait que l’Ordre ait développé des normes de pratiques pour guider les praticiens en MTC/A et ait mis en place un protocole pour traiter les réclamations du public est un signe de progrès en direction de ces objectifs.	10.13162/hro-ors.v3i2.2441	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	4	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/hro-ors/article/view/2796	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
