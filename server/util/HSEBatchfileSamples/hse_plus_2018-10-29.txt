METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were used to identify all relevant articles. Clinical outcomes including International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, and Lysholm scores; joint laxity; and posterior tibial displacement were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 145 unique articles identified during the title screening, 25 studies published between 2002 and 2016 with a combined population of 900 patients were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. Of the 900 patients, 603 were treated with autograft and 297 were treated with allograft PCL reconstruction. Five of the included studies directly compared autograft and allograft PCL reconstruction. Most studies found postoperative functional outcomes and joint laxity to improve postoperatively regardless of graft source. With only 1 exception, the included comparative studies found no significant postoperative difference in any of the functional outcome scores between patients treated with allograft and those treated with autograft. Two comparative studies found autograft reconstruction to result in significantly less posterior laxity than in the allograft group, whereas 2 comparative studies found no significant difference in posterior laxity between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCL reconstruction results in improved functional outcome scores and joint laxity regardless of graft source. Current studies suggest there is no significant difference in postoperative functional outcomes between patients treated with autograft and those treated with allograft. Patients treated with autograft have donor-site morbidity that is not associated with allograft reconstruction. Some evidence suggests that autograft reconstruction may result in reduced posterior laxity relative to allograft reconstruction. The magnitude of this finding, however, may not be clinically significant. Our review found that decision making based on the current literature is at high risk of potential bias. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1316	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Agitation in people with dementia worsens carer burden, increases the risk of injury, and adds to the need for institutionalisation. Valproate preparations have been used in an attempt to control agitation in dementia, but their safety and efficacy have been questioned. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of valproate preparations used to treat agitation in people with dementia, including the impact on carers. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group`s Specialized Register on 7 December 2017 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials that assessed valproate preparations for agitation in people with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data in meta-analyses where possible. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2009. We found no new studies for inclusion. MAIN RESULTS: The review included five studies with 430 participants. Studies varied in the preparations of valproate, mean doses (480 mg/day to 1000 mg/day), duration of treatment (three weeks to six weeks), and outcome measures used. The studies were generally well conducted although some methodological information was missing and one study was at high risk of attrition bias.The quality of evidence related to our primary efficacy outcome of agitation varied from moderate to very low. We found moderate-quality evidence from two studies that measured behaviour with the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (range 0 to 108) and with the BPRS agitation factor (range 0 to 18). They found that there was probably little or no effect of valproate treatment over six weeks (total BPRS: mean difference (MD) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.14 to 2.59; 202 participants, 2 studies; BPRS agitation factor: MD -0.67, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.15; 202 participants, 2 studies). Very low-quality evidence from three studies which measured agitation with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI) were consistent with a lack of effect of valproate treatment on agitation. There was variable quality evidence on other behaviour outcomes reported in single studies of no difference between groups or a benefit for the placebo group.Three studies, which measured cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), found little or no effect of valproate over six weeks, but we were uncertain about this result because the quality of the evidence was very low. Two studies that assessed functional ability using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) (range 6 to 30) found that there was probably slightly worse function in the valproate-treated group, which was of uncertain clinical importance (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.98; 203 participants, 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence).Analysis of adverse effects and serious adverse events (SAE) indicated a higher incidence in valproate-treated participants. A meta-analysis of three studies showed that there may have been a higher rate of adverse effects among valproate-treated participants than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.14; 381 participants, 3 studies, low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis of the number of SAE for the two studies that reported such data indicated that participants treated with valproate preparations were more likely to experience SAEs (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 22.74; 228 participants, 2 studies), but the very low quality of the data made t difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding SAEs. Individual adverse events that were more frequent in the valproate-treated group included sedation, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), and urinary tract infections. AUTHORS` CONCLUSIONS: This updated review corroborates earlier findings that valproate preparations are probably ineffective in treating agitation in people with dementia, but are associated with a higher rate of adverse effects, and possibly of SAEs. On the basis of this evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia. Further research may not be justified, particularly in light of the increased risk of adverse effects in this often frail group of people. Research would be better focused on effective non-pharmacological interventions for this patient group, or, for those situations where medication may be need		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1314	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, complications or unintended outcomes are frequently noted in clinical series. There has been no rigorous systematic review of studies reporting outcomes of surgical treatment for hallux valgus deformity, to the best of our knowledge. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies reporting the outcomes of surgical correction for hallux valgus deformity. RESULTS: A total of 229 studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled rates of postoperative patient dissatisfaction and postoperative first metatarsophalangeal pain were 10.6% and 1.5%, respectively. The overall rate of recurrent deformity was 4.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Hallux valgus surgery has been reported to have fairly consistent results and rates of complications or unfavorable outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed for publications reporting multidisciplinary pathways in the management of cesarean delivery for patients with morbidly adherent placenta. EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, PubMed Central, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Databases were searched for studies reporting maternal morbidity of patients with morbidly adherent placenta managed by a multidisciplinary team in a specialist center compared with standard care. Two independent reviewers applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select included articles, with differences agreed by consensus. A total of 252 citations were reviewed; six studies comprising 461 patients were selected for the analysis. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Literature search was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results were reported as mean differences or pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Estimated blood loss was significantly reduced in the multidisciplinary team group (mean difference -1.1 L, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.4, P=.004) and these patients had lower transfusion requirements (mean difference -2.7 units, 95% CI -4.1 to -1.2, P=.040). Those treated in a standard care setting were more likely to develop complications (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.0, P&lt;.001); however, there was no difference in length of stay between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis highlights the improved maternal outcomes in patients with morbidly adherent placenta when managed by a multidisciplinary team in a specialist center. High-risk complex cases warrant expert management in centralized units.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1313	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

In addition, the risk-benefit ratio of potent oral P2Y12-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists (PPAs), namely, prasugrel and ticagrelor, compared with clopidogrel in CKD patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis of all studies comparing the clinical outcomes of PPA and clopidogrel therapy in CKD patients suffering from ACS. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Clinical trial.org and the abstracts of international cardiology congresses from April 2000 to October 2017. Clinical studies comparing PPA with clopidogrel in ACS patients with CKD were selected. Our literature research identified five studies which were included in the meta-analysis. The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) at the latest follow-up available. Secondary endpoint included bleedings. RESULTS: We included data from three sub-group analysis of randomized clinical trials and two prospective observational studies (n = 31,234). Overall, PPAs were associated with lower rates of major cardiovascular events, with a pooled hazard ratio (pHR) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.99; p = 0.03), without increased bleedings (pHR = 1.10) (95% CI: 0.95-1.27; p = 0.18). In a sensitivity analysis restricted to studies enrolling invasively managed patients, the benefit of PPA on MACE was maintained (pHR = 0.85) (95% CI: 0.77-0.93; p &lt; 0.001), including a reduction in mortality (pHR = 0.82) (95% CI: 0.7-0.96; p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Compared with clopidogrel, PPAs were associated with a reduced rate of MACE without increased bleedings in CKD patients with ACS. Among invasively managed patients, this benefit from PPA included a reduction in mortality.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1301	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Quinlivan, R.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	CD009068-CD009068	[EndPage]	Cochrane Database Syst Rev		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	10	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: The dystrophinopathies include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM). In recent years, co-ordinated multidisciplinary management for these diseases has improved the quality of care, with early corticosteroid use prolonging independent ambulation, and the routine use of non-invasive ventilation signficantly increasing survival. The next target to improve outcomes is optimising treatments to delay the onset or slow the progression of cardiac involvement and so prolong survival further. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing or treating cardiac involvement in DMD, BMD, and XLDCM, using measures of change in cardiac function over six months. SEARCH METHODS: On 16 October 2017 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, and on 12 December 2017, we searched two clinical trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and bibliographies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and randomised cross-over trials for inclusion. In the Discussion, we reviewed open studies, longitudinal observational studies and individual case reports but only discussed studies that adequately described the diagnosis, intervention, pretreatment, and post-treatment states and in which follow-up lasted for at least six months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified from the search and performed data extraction. All three authors assessed risk of bias independently, compared results, and decided which trials met the inclusion criteria. They assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We included five studies (N = 205) in the review; four studies included participants with DMD only, and one study included participants with DMD or BMD. All studied different interventions, and meta-analysis was not possible. We found no studies for XLDCM. None of the trials reported cardiac function as improved or stable cardiac versus deteriorated.The randomised first part of a two-part study of perindopril (N = 28) versus placebo (N = 27) in boys with DMD with normal heart function at baseline showed no difference in the number of participants with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) of less than 45% after three years of therapy (n = 1 in each group; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.77). This result is uncertain because of study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. In a non-randomised follow-up study, after 10 years, more participants who had received placebo from the beginning had reduced LVEF% (less than 45%). Adverse event rates were similar between the placebo and treatment groups (low-certainty evidence).A study comparing treatment with lisinopril versus losartan in 23 boys newly diagnosed with Duchenne cardiomyopathy showed that after 12 months, both were equally effective in preserving or improving LVEF% (lisinopril 54.6% (standard deviation (SD) 5.19), losartan 55.2% (SD 7.19); mean difference (MD) -0.60% CI -6.67 to 5.47: N = 16). The certainty of evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and study limitations (risk of bias). Two participants in the losartan group were withdrawn due to adverse events: one participant developed an allergic reaction, and a second exceeded the safety standard with a fall in ejection fraction greater than 10%. Authors reported no other adverse events related to the medication (N = 22; very low-certainty evidence).A study comparing idebenone versus placebo in 21 boys with DMD showed little or no difference in mean change in cardiac function between the two groups from baseline to 12 months; for fractional shortening the mean change was 1.4% (SD 4.1) in the idebenone group and 1.6% (SD 2.6) in the placebo group (MD -0.20%, 95% CI -3.07 to 2.67, N = 21), and for ejection fraction the mean change was -1.9% (SD 9.8) in the idebenone group and 0.4% (SD 5.5) in the placebo group (MD -2.30%, 95% CI -9.18 to 4.58, N = 21). The certainty of evidence was very low because of study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reported adverse events were similar between the treatment and placebo groups (low-certainty evidence).A multicentre controlled study added eplerenone or placebo to 42 patients with DMD with early cardiomyopathy but preserved left ventricular function already established on ACEI or ARB therapy. Results showed that eplerenone slowed the rate of decline of magnetic resonance (MR)-assessed left ventricular circumferential strain at 12 months (eplerenone group median 1.0%, interquartile range (IQR) 0.3 to -2.2; placebo group median 2.2%, IQR 1.3 to -3.1%; P = 0.020). The median decline in LVEF over the same period was also less in the eplerenone group (-1.8%, IQR -2.9 to 6.0) than in the placebo group (-3.7%, IQR -10.8 to 1.0; P = 0.032).

Radiotherapy has been reported to reduce pain in LAPC. Stereotactic RT (SBRT) is considered as an emerging radiotherapy technique able to achieve high local control rates with acceptable toxicity. However, its role in pain palliation is not clear. To review the impact on pain relief with SBRT in LAPC patients, a literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase (January 2000-December 2017) for prospective and retrospective articles published in English. Fourteen studies (479 patients) reporting the effect of SBRT on pain relief were finally included in this analysis. SBRT was delivered with both standard and/or robotic linear accelerators. The median prescribed SBRT doses ranged from 16.5 to 45 Gy (median: 27.8 Gy), and the number of fractions ranged from 1 to 6 (median: 3.5). Twelve of the 14 studies reported the percentage of pain relief (in patients with pain at presentation) with a global overall response rate (complete and partial response) of 84.9% (95% CI, 75.8%-91.5%), with high heterogeneity (Q (2) test: P&lt;0.001; I2=83.63%). All studies reported toxicity data. Acute and late toxicity (grade >/=3) rates were 3.3%-18.0% and 6.0%-8.2%, respectively. Reported gastrointestinal side effects were duodenal obstruction/ulcer, small bowel obstruction, duodenal bleeding, hemorrhage, and gastric perforation. SBRT achieves pain relief in most patients with pancreatic cancer with an acceptable gastrointestinal toxicity rate. Further prospective studies are needed to define optimal dose/fractionation and the best systemic therapies modality integration to reduce toxicity and improve the palliative outcome. Finally, the quality of life and, particularly, pain control should be considered as an endpoint in all future trials on this emerging treatment technique.

BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents have a high risk of falling. No conclusive evidence exists on the effectiveness of exercise on fall prevention in nursing home residents. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA RESOURCES: Databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and China Biology Medicine were searched from inception to March 2017, with no language limitation. REVIEW METHODS: The review was conducted according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Studies on exercise interventions to prevent falls in nursing home residents were eligible. The primary outcome was the odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals of falls. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis where exercise was compared with daily routine, social activities, and other methods in preventing falls. About falls, the pooled effect size of seven studies showed that exercise had no effect on fall prevention in nursing home residents. There was low heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that exercise did not play a role in preventing falls. Further studies with high quality and larger samples are required to support or counter the results.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1310	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Obesity is associated with health problems such as increased risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, various types of cancer, gallstones, and disability. Obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years. Objective: To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on interventions (behavioral and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting. Findings: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; these interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (including weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity are small to none. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive behavioral interventions or behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions has a moderate net benefit. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer or refer adults with a body mass index of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.

Methods An international multidisciplinary panel of experts in pediatric oncology and infectious diseases with patient advocate representation was convened. We performed systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials for the prevention or treatment of CDI in any population and considered the directness of the evidence to children with cancer and pediatric HSCT patients. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to generate recommendations. Results The panel made strong recommendations to administer either oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin for the initial treatment of nonsevere CDI and oral vancomycin for the initial treatment of severe CDI. Fidaxomicin may be considered in the setting of recurrent CDI. The panel suggested that probiotics not be routinely used for the prevention of CDI, and that monoclonal antibodies and probiotics not be routinely used for the treatment of CDI. A strong recommendation to not use fecal microbiota transplantation was made in this population. We identified key knowledge gaps and suggested directions for future research. Conclusion We present a guideline for the prevention and treatment of CDI in children and adolescents with cancer and pediatric HSCT patients. Future research should include randomized controlled trials that involve children with cancer and pediatric HSCT patients to improve the management of CDI in this population.

The long-term prognosis is often poor, with severe developmental, medical and psychosocial complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. `Family therapy approaches` indicate a range of approaches, derived from different theories, that involve the family in treatment. We have included therapies developed on the basis of dominant family systems theories, approaches that are based on or broadly similar to the family-based therapy derived from the Maudsley model, approaches that incorporate a focus on cognitive restructuring, as well as approaches that involve the family without articulation of a theoretical approach.This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of family therapy approaches compared with standard treatment and other treatments for AN. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) and PsycINFO (OVID) (all years to April 2016). We ran additional searches directly on Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 2008 and 2016 to 2018). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, together with four theses databases (all years to 2018). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have included in the analyses only studies from searches conducted to April 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of family therapy approaches compared to any other intervention or other types of family therapy approaches were eligible for inclusion. We included participants of any age or gender with a primary clinical diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random-effects meta-analysis. We used the risk ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 trials in this version of the review (13 from the original 2010 review and 12 newly-included studies). Sixteen trials were of adolescents, eight trials of adults (seven of these in young adults aged up to 26 years) and one trial included three age groups: one adolescent, one young adult and one adult. Most investigated family-based therapy or variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate, so that in a large number of studies we rated the risk of bias as unclear for many of the domains. Selective reporting bias was particularly problematic, with 68% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area, followed by incomplete outcome data, with 44% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area. For the main outcome measure of remission there was some low-quality evidence (from only two studies, 81 participants) suggesting that family therapy approaches might offer some advantage over treatment as usual on rates of remission, post intervention (risk ratio (RR) 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 8.23; I(2) = 0%). However, at follow-up, low-quality evidence from only one study suggested this effect was not maintained. There was very low-quality evidence from only one trial, which means it is difficult to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational interventions for remission (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.53 to 153.79; 1 study, N = 30). Similarly, there was very low-quality evidence from only five trials for remission post-intervention, again meaning that it is difficult to determine whether there is any advantage of family therapy approaches over psychological interventions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; participants = 252; studies = 5; I(2) = 37%) and at long-term follow-up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28; participants = 200; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I(2) = 0%). There was no indication that the age group had any impact on the overall treatment effect; however, it should be noted that there were very few trials undertaken in adults, with the age range of adult studies included in this analysis from 20 to 27. There was some evidence of a small effect favouring family based therapy compared with other psychological interventions in terms of weight gain post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; participants = 210; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I(2) = 11%) .

JOUR	[BLANK]	Humanization of critical care-psychological effects on healthcare professionals and relatives: a systematic review	Galvin IML, J.  Gill, R.  Poser, K.  McKeown, S.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Can J Anaesth		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	PURPOSE: To systematically review and evaluate the effects of humanized care of the critically ill on empathy among healthcare professionals, anxiety among relatives, and burnout and compassion fatigue in both groups. SOURCE: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ProQuest Dissertations were searched from inception to 29 June 2017 for studies that investigated the effects of interventions with potential to humanize care of the critically ill on the following outcomes: empathy among critical care professionals, anxiety among relatives, and burnout and compassion fatigue in either group. We defined a humanizing intervention as one with substantial potential to increase physical or emotional proximity to the patient. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and data quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twelve studies addressing four discrete interventions (liberal visitation, diaries, family participation in basic care, and witnessed resuscitation) and one mixed intervention were included. Ten studies measured anxiety among 1,055 relatives. Two studies measured burnout in 288 critical care professionals. None addressed empathy or compassion fatigue. Eleven of the included studies had an overall high risk of bias. No pooled estimates of effect were calculated as a priori criteria for data synthesis were not met. CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence to make any quantitative assessment of the effect of humanizing interventions on any of these psychologic outcomes. We observed a trend towards reduced anxiety among family members who participated in basic patient care, liberal visitation, and diary keeping. We found conflicting effects of liberal visitation on burnout among healthcare professionals.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1291	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Maltais, F.  Lacasse, Y.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	CD012290-CD012290	[EndPage]	Cochrane Database Syst Rev		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	10	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: Active mind-body movement therapies (AMBMTs), including but not limited to yoga, tai chi, and qigong, have been applied as exercise modalities for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). AMBMT strategies have been found to be more effective than usual care; however, whether AMBMT is inferior, equivalent, or superior to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in people with COPD remains to be determined. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of AMBMTs compared with, or in addition to, PR in the management of COPD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and major Chinese databases, as well as trial registries from inception to July 2017. In addition, we searched references of primary studies and review articles. We updated this search in July 2018 but have not yet incorporated these results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing AMBMT (i.e. controlled breathing and/or focused meditation/attention interventions for which patients must actively move their joints and muscles for at least four weeks with no minimum intervention frequency) versus PR (any inpatient or outpatient, community-based or home-based rehabilitation programme lasting at least four weeks, with no minimum intervention frequency, that included conventional exercise training with or without education or psychological support) and (2) RCTs comparing AMBMT + PR versus PR alone in people with COPD. Two independent review authors screened and selected studies for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors if necessary to ask them to provide missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We included in the meta-analysis 10 studies with 762 participants across one or more comparisons. The sample size of included studies ranged from 11 to 206 participants. Nine out of 10 studies involving all levels of COPD severity were conducted in China with adults from 55 to 88 years of age, a higher proportion of whom were male (78%). Nine out of 10 studies provided tai chi and/or qigong programmes as AMBMT, and one study provided yoga. Overall, the term `PR` has been uncritically applied in the vast majority of studies, which limits comparison of AMBMT and PR. For example, eight out of 10 studies considered walking training as equal to PR and used this as conventional exercise training within PR. Overall study quality for main comparisons was moderate to very low mainly owing to imprecision, indirectness (exercise component inconsistent with recommendations), and risk of bias issues. The primary outcomes for our review were quality of life, dyspnoea, and serious adverse events.When researchers compared AMBMT versus PR alone (mainly unstructured walking training), statistically significant improvements in disease-specific quality of life (QoL) (St. George`s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score) favoured AMBMT: mean difference (MD) -5.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.75 to -2.92; three trials; 249 participants; low-quality evidence. The common effect size, but not the 95% CI around the pooled treatment effect, exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of minus four. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) also revealed statistically significant improvements favouring AMBMT over PR, with scores exceeding the MCID of three, with an MD of 6.58 units (95% CI -9.16 to - 4.00 units; one trial; 74 participants; low-quality evidence). Results show no between-group differences with regard to dyspnoea measured by the modified Medical Research Council Scale (MD 0.00 units, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.37; two trials; 127 participants; low-quality evidence), the Borg Scale (MD 0.44 units, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.00; one trial; 139 participants; low-quality evidence), or the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnoea Scale (MD -0.21, 95% CI -2.81 to 2.38; one trial; 11 participant ; low-quality evidence). Comparisons of AMBMT versus PR alone did not include assessments of generic quality of life, adverse events, limb muscle function, exacerbations, or adherence.Comparisons of AMBMT added to PR versus PR alone (mainly unstructured walking training) revealed significant improvements in generic QoL as measured by Short Form (SF)-36 for both the SF-36 general health summary score (MD 5.42, 95% CI 3.82 to 7.02; one trial; 80 participants; very low-quality evidence) and the SF-36 mental health summary score (MD 3.29, 95% CI 1.45 to 4.95; one trial; 80 participants; very low-quality evidence). With regard to disease-specific QoL, investigators noted no significant improvement with addition of AMBMT to PR versus PR alone (SGRQ total score: MD -2.57, 95% CI -7.76 to 2.62 units; one trial; 192 participants; moderate-quality evidence; CRQ Dyspnoea Scale score: MD 0.04, 95% CI -2.18		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1303	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Symptomatic, high-grade dislocations may be managed by a myriad of operative techniques that utilize different grafts to achieve reduction. Comparative data are lacking on the ability of these techniques to achieve excellent patient outcomes and stable AC reduction and to minimize complications. PURPOSE: To systematically review the outcomes and complications of different techniques of AC joint reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed to perform a systematic review of the scientific literature from 2000 to 2018 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria with the following keywords: ``acromioclavicular`` and ``reconstruction.`` Included articles were evaluated for loss of reduction, complication rate, revision rate, and change in coracoclavicular distance. Articles were stratified by graft and surgical material used: suture only, Endobutton with suture, TightRope, GraftRope, synthetic artificial ligament, tendon graft, and Weaver-Dunn coracoacromial ligament transfer. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and stratified by surgical technique and arthroscopic versus open reconstruction. RESULTS: Fifty-eight articles were included in the analysis, with 63 homogeneous populations composed of 1704 patients. The mean age was 37.1 years (range, 15-80 years) with a mean follow-up of 34.3 months (range, 1.5-186 months). The overall failure rate was 20.8% (95% CI, 16.9%-25.2%). The overall pooled complication rate was 14.2% (95% CI, 10.5%-18.8%). The most common complications were infection (6.3% [95% CI, 4.7%-8.2%]), fracture to the coracoid or distal clavicle (5.7% [95% CI, 4.3%-7.6%]), and hardware/button failure (4.2% [95% CI, 3.1%-5.8%]). There were no differences between arthroscopic and open techniques in regard to loss of reduction ( P = .858), overall complication rate ( P = .774), and revision rate ( P = .390). Open surgery had a greater rate of clavicular/coracoid fractures than arthroscopic surgery ( P = .048). Heterogeneity, best assessed from the pooled loss of reduction, was measured as I(2) = 64.0%. CONCLUSION: Open and arthroscopic AC joint reconstruction techniques have no differences in loss of reduction, the complication rate, and the revision rate based on the available literature. Complications are significant, and profiles vary between surgical techniques, which should be evaluated in the decision making of selecting the technique.

Dahm, P.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	CD007360-CD007360	[EndPage]	Cochrane Database Syst Rev		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	10	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in ageing men that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Treatment aims are to relieve symptoms and prevent disease-related complications. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker (AB) that has a high affinity for the A1d receptor that may have advantages in treating LUTS in this setting. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. Since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of naftopidil for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILAC, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up to 31 May 2018 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all parallel RCTs. We also included cross-over design trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary outcomes were urological symptom scores, quality of life (QoL) and treatment withdrawals for any reason; secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, acute urinary retention, surgical intervention for BPH, and cardiovascular and sexual adverse events. We considered outcomes measured up to 12 months after randomisation as short term, and later than 12 months as long term. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 RCTs with 2223 randomised participants across four comparisons for short-term follow-up. This abstract focuses on only two of four comparisons for which we found data since two comparators (i.e. propiverine and Eviprostat (phytotherapy)) are rarely used. One study comparing naftopidil to placebo did not report any relevant outcomes and was therefore excluded. There were no trials that compared to combination therapy with naftopidil or any 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) to combination therapy with other ABs and any 5-ARIs.All included studies were conducted in Asian countries. Study duration ranged from four to 12 weeks. Mean age was 67.8 years, prostate volume was 35.4 mL, and International Prostate Symptom Score was 18.3. We were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on age and baseline symptom score.Naftopidil versus tamsulosinBased on 12 studies with 965 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in urological symptom score (mean difference (MD) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 1.04 measured on a scale from 0 to 35 with higher score representing increased symptoms), QoL (MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.30; measured on a scale from 0 to 6 with higher scores representing worse QoL), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; corresponding to 7 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 32 fewer to 31 more). Naftopidil may have resulted in little to no difference in sexual adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22); this would result in 26 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 43 fewer to 13 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for urological symptom score and low for the other outcomes.Naftopidil versus silodosinBased on five studies with 652 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in the urological symptom scores (MD 1.04, 95% CI -0.78 to 2.85), QoL (MD 0.21, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.66), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.23; corresponding to 26 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 62 fewer to 32 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as low for all these outcomes. Naftopidil likely educed sexual adverse events (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; corresponding to 126 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 139 fewer to 86 fewer). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for sexual adverse events. AUTHORS` CONCLUSIONS: Naftopidil appears to have similar effects in the urological symptom scores and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. Naftopidil has similar sexual adverse events compared to tamsulosin but has fewer compared to silodosin.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1320	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

As a consequence of the growing number of cancer survivors, the incidence of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is increasing. However, the optimal primary preventive strategy is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of carvedilol for the primary prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted. The primary and secondary outcomes were the occurrence of low left ventricular ejection fraction, and the absolute change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), respectively. We calculated the odds ratios for the primary outcome and the weighted mean differences for the secondary outcomes using a random-effects model. We included 8 randomized controlled trials (633 total patients). Our results showed significantly reduced rates of low LVEF favoring the carvedilol group (3.2% vs 5.8%; odds ratios: 0.42; 95% confidence interval: 0.18 to 0.99; p=0.05). Furthermore, there were significantly smaller reductions in LVEF in carvedilol-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (mean differences: 2.41%; 95% confidence interval: 0.01 to 4.81; p = 0.05). In conclusion, prophylactic administration of carvedilol in anthracycline-treated cancer patients may reduce the early onset of left ventricular dysfunction compared with placebo.

Giordano, A.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	CD008757-CD008757	[EndPage]	Cochrane Database Syst Rev		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	10	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with a number of important uncertainties concerning many aspects of the disease. These include diagnosis, prognosis, disease course, disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic therapies, and non-pharmacological interventions, among others. While people with MS demand adequate information to be able to actively participate in medical decision making and to self manage their disease, it has been shown that patients` disease-related knowledge is poor, therefore guidelines recommend clear and concise high-quality information at all stages of the disease. Several studies have outlined communication and information deficits in the care of people with MS. However, only a few information and decision support programmes have been published. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this updated review was to evaluate the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS that aim to promote informed choice and improve patient-relevant outcomes, Further objectives were to evaluate the components and the developmental processes of the complex interventions used, to highlight the quantity and the certainty of the research evidence available, and to set an agenda for future research. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register, which contains trials from CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and clinical trials registries (29 November 2017) as well as other sources. We also searched reference lists of identified articles and contacted trialists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials, and quasi-randomised trials comparing information provision for people with MS or suspected MS (intervention groups) with usual care or other types of information provision (control groups) were eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias. We contacted authors of relevant studies for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one new RCT (73 participants), which when added to the 10 previously included RCTs resulted in a total of 11 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (1387 participants overall; mean age, range: 31 to 51; percentage women, range: 63% to 100%; percentage relapsing-remitting MS course, range: 45% to 100%). The interventions addressed a variety of topics using different approaches for information provision in different settings. Topics included disease-modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. The active intervention components included decision aids, decision coaching, educational programmes, self care programmes, and personal interviews with physicians. All studies used one or more components, but the number and extent differed markedly between studies. The studies had a variable risk of bias. We did not perform meta-analyses due to marked clinical heterogeneity. All five studies assessing MS-related knowledge (505 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) detected significant differences between groups as a result of the interventions, indicating that information provision may successfully increase participants` knowledge. There were mixed results on decision making (five studies, 793 participants; low-certainty evidence) and quality of life (six studies, 671 participants; low-certainty evidence). No adverse events were detected in the seven studies reporting this outcome. AUTHORS` CONCLUSIONS: Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease-related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life. The included studies in this review reported no negat ve side effects of providing disease-related information to people with MS. Interpretation of study results remains challenging due to the marked heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures.

Main efficacy outcomes were pain, function and hand strength. Risk of bias was assessed. Meta-analysis was performed when advisable. Of 7036 records, 127 references were included, of which 50 studies concerned non-pharmacological, 64 pharmacological and 12 surgical interventions. Many studies had high risk of bias, mainly due to inadequate randomisation or blinding. Beneficial non-pharmacological treatments included hand exercise and prolonged thumb base splinting, while single trials showed positive results for joint protection and using assistive devices. Topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) proved equally effective, while topical NSAIDs led to less adverse events. Single trials demonstrated positive results for chondroitin sulfate and intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in interphalangeal joints. Pharmacological treatments for which no clear beneficial effect was shown include paracetamol, intra-articular thumb base injections of glucocorticoids or hyaluronic acid, low-dose oral glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and anti-tumour necrosis factor. No trials compared surgery to sham or non-operative treatment. No surgical intervention for thumb base OA appeared more effective than another, although in general more complex procedures led to more complications. No interventions slowed radiographic progression. In conclusion, an overview of the evidence on efficacy and safety of treatment options for hand OA was presented and informed the task force for the updated European League Against Rheumatism management recommendations for hand OA.

Objective: To systematically review evidence on benefits and harms of behavioral and pharmacotherapy weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions in adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed Publisher-Supplied Records, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published through June 6, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials through August 2017; and ongoing surveillance in targeted publications through March 23, 2018. Studies from previous reviews were reevaluated for inclusion. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) focusing on weight loss or weight loss maintenance in adults. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were abstracted by one reviewer and confirmed by another. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for weight loss outcomes in behavior-based interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Health outcomes, weight loss or weight loss maintenance, reduction in obesity-related conditions, and adverse events. Results: A total of 122 RCTs (N = 62533) and 2 observational studies (N = 209993) were identified. Compared with controls, participants in behavior-based interventions had greater mean weight loss at 12 to 18 months (-2.39 kg [95% CI, -2.86 to -1.93]; 67 studies [n = 22065]) and less weight regain (-1.59 kg [95% CI, -2.38 to -0.79]; 8 studies [n = 1408]). Studies of medication-based weight loss and maintenance interventions also reported greater weight loss or less weight regain in intervention compared with placebo groups at 12 to 18 months (range, -0.6 to -5.8 kg; no meta-analysis). Participants with prediabetes in weight loss interventions had a lower risk of developing diabetes compared with controls (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89]). There was no evidence of other benefits, but most health outcomes such as mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer were infrequently reported. Small improvements in quality of life in some medication trials were noted but were of unclear clinical significance. There was no evidence of harm such as cardiovascular disease from behavior-based interventions; higher rates of adverse events were associated with higher dropout rates in medication groups than in placebo groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Behavior-based weight loss interventions with or without weight loss medications were associated with more weight loss and a lower risk of developing diabetes than control conditions. Weight loss medications, but not behavior-based interventions, were associated with higher rates of harms.

METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases were searched for relevant articles comparing the outcomes of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) treatment published up until August 2017. Data searching, extraction, analysis, and quality assessment were performed based on The Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using various outcome values in various techniques. For results with high heterogeneity, 95% prediction intervals (PIs) were also investigated. RESULTS: Eleven clinical studies were investigated. In patients with primary patellar dislocation, there were no significant differences in all evaluated outcomes between the conservative and surgical treatment groups. For patients with recurrent patellar dislocation, MPFL reconstruction was associated with a favorable Kujala score (mean difference, -8.91; 95% confidence interval, -14.05 to -3.77; I(2) = 94%; 95% PI, -9.64 to -8.1) and Lysholm score (mean difference, -13.51; 95% confidence interval, -21.35 to -5.68; I(2) = 96%; 95% PI, -14.86 to -12.16) when compared with soft tissue realignment surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical treatment of the MPFL for primary patellar dislocation is not superior to conservative treatment in restoring knee function and clinical outcomes, MPFL reconstruction is associated with more favorable clinical outcomes compared with medial soft tissue realignment surgery in patients with recurrent patellar dislocation. Double-bundle MPFL reconstruction seems to provide more favorable outcomes than single-bundle MPFL reconstruction, but this finding should be interpreted with caution because the evidence levels were low and were from only a few studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, meta-analysis.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1308	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Peinemann, F.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	CD010318-CD010318	[EndPage]	Cochrane Database Syst Rev		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	10	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding its use. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. SEARCH METHODS: In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing.NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative woundsTwo studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow-up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision).NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcersThere were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow-up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the number of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I(2) = 0%; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision).Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I(2) = 0%; low-certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision).Low-pressure compared with high-pressure NPWT for foot ulcersOne study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg.

A meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to establish whether application of PVI before wound closure could reduce surgical site infection (SSI) rates. METHODS: Systematic review of MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases from inception to September 2017, with no language restrictions. Only RCTs were retrieved. The primary outcome was the SSI rate. Meta-analysis was complemented with trial sequential analysis (TSA). RESULTS: A total of 7601 patients collected from 16 RCTs were analyzed. A reduction in overall SSI rate was found (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.85, P = 0.002, I(2) = 65%), which was attributed to patients undergoing elective operations (n = 2358) and mixed elective/urgent operations (n = 2019). When RCTs of uncertain quality (n = 9) were excluded, the use of PVI before wound closure (n = 4322 patients) was not associated with a significant reduction of SSI (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.55-1.20, P = 0.29, I(2) = 51%) and was only significant in clean wounds (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.70, P = 0.008, I(2) = 0%). For the primary outcome, the TSA calculation using a relative risk reduction of 19% and an 11% proportion of control event rate (CER) with 51% of I(2), the accrued information size (n = 4322) was 32.8% of the estimated optimal information size (n = 13,148). CONCLUSIONS: There is no conclusive evidence for a strong recommendation of topical PVI before wound closure to prevent SSI.

Findings from systematic reviews have been mixed, and effects of these interventions have not been quantitatively estimated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of interventions implemented up to 18 years of age for the primary or secondary prevention of multiple risk behaviours among young people. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 11 databases (Australian Education Index; British Education Index; Campbell Library; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; Embase; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; and Sociological Abstracts) on three occasions (2012, 2015, and 14 November 2016)). We conducted handsearches of reference lists, contacted experts in the field, conducted citation searches, and searched websites of relevant organisations. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs, which aimed to address at least two risk behaviours. Participants were children and young people up to 18 years of age and/or parents, guardians, or carers, as long as the intervention aimed to address involvement in multiple risk behaviours among children and young people up to 18 years of age. However, studies could include outcome data on children > 18 years of age at the time of follow-up. Specifically,we included studies with outcomes collected from those eight to 25 years of age. Further, we included only studies with a combined intervention and follow-up period of six months or longer. We excluded interventions aimed at individuals with clinically diagnosed disorders along with clinical interventions. We categorised interventions according to whether they were conducted at the individual level; the family level; or the school level. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified a total of 34,680 titles, screened 27,691 articles and assessed 424 full-text articles for eligibility. Two or more review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.We pooled data in meta-analyses using a random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) model in RevMan 5.3. For each outcome, we included subgroups related to study type (individual, family, or school level, and universal or targeted approach) and examined effectiveness at up to 12 months` follow-up and over the longer term (> 12 months). We assessed the quality and certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included in the review a total of 70 eligible studies, of which a substantial proportion were universal school-based studies (n = 28; 40%). Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 55; 79%). On average, studies aimed to prevent four of the primary behaviours. Behaviours that were most frequently addressed included alcohol use (n = 55), drug use (n = 53), and/or antisocial behaviour (n = 53), followed by tobacco use (n = 42). No studies aimed to prevent self-harm or gambling alongside other behaviours.Evidence suggests that for multiple risk behaviours, universal school-based interventions were beneficial in relation to tobacco use (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.97; n = 9 studies; 15,354 participants) and alcohol use (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92; n = 8 studies; 8751 participants; both moderate-quality evidence) compared to a comparator, and that such interventions may be effective in preventing illicit drug use (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; n = 5 studies; 11,058 participants; low-quality evidence) and engagement in any antisocial beh viour (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; n = 13 studies; 20,756 participants; very low-quality evidence) at up to 12 months` follow-up, although there was evidence of moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 49% to 69%). Moderate-quality evidence also showed that multiple risk behaviour universal school-based interventions improved the odds of physical activity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.50; I(2) = 0%; n = 4 studies; 6441 participants). We considered observed effects to be of public health importance when applied at the population level.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Older adults with asthma or COPD, either in primary or secondary health care and pharmacy setting. MEASUREMENTS: We searched the Medline, Embase, and Central databases according to the main eligibility criteria for inclusion: systematic reviews, meta-analysis, clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies; participants aged 65 and older; education on inhaler technique and reporting of disease control and exacerbation rates. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations scale for quality assessment and used a random-effect model with Mantel-Haenszel adjustment to perform a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 8 studies (4 randomized, 4 quasi-experimental) with a total of 1,812 participants. The most frequent type of intervention was physical demonstration of inhaler technique, training with placebo devices. Five studies showed significant reduction in exacerbation rates (pooled risk ratio=0.71, 95% confidence interval=0.59-0.86; p &lt; .001), although effect on disease control and quality of life showed high discrepancy in the reported results, and all randomized studies revealed uncertainty in their risk of bias assessment. CONCLUSION: All interventions seemed to improve inhaler performance and clinically relevant outcomes, but a placebo device could be the most effective. There is evidence that interventions reduce exacerbation risk in older adults, although to an overall moderate degree.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1297	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

It is unclear whether newborn infants may benefit from this therapy and whether naloxone has any harmful effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of naloxone on the need for and duration of neonatal unit stay in infants of mothers who received opioid analgesia prior to delivery or of mothers who have used a prescribed or non-prescribed opioid during pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases in February 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCO), Maternity and Infant Care (OvidSP), and PubMed. We searched for ongoing and completed trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the EU Clinical Trials Register. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify further potentially relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing the administration of naloxone versus placebo, or no drug, or another dose of naloxone to newborn infants with suspected or confirmed in utero exposure to opioid. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors and synthesis of data using risk ratio, risk difference, and mean difference. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine trials, with 316 participants in total, that compared the effects of naloxone versus placebo or no drug in newborn infants exposed to maternal opioid analgesia prior to delivery. None of the included trials investigated infants born to mothers who had used a prescribed or non-prescribed opioid during pregnancy. None of these trials specifically recruited infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression. The main outcomes reported were measures of respiratory function in the first six hours after birth. There is some evidence that naloxone increases alveolar ventilation. The trials did not assess the effect on the primary outcomes of this review (admission to a neonatal unit and failure to establish breastfeeding). AUTHORS` CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to determine whether naloxone confers any important benefits to newborn infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression that may be due to intrauterine exposure to opioid. Given concerns about the safety of naloxone in this context, it may be appropriate to limit its use to randomised controlled trials that aim to resolve these uncertainties.

DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials that compared vasopressin and its analogs with other vasopressors and reported renal outcomes in adult patients with distributive shock. DATA EXTRACTION: Paired reviewers independently screened citations, conducted data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Three prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted. Three main outcomes related to acute renal failure were analyzed: the need for renal replacement therapy, acute kidney injury incidence, and acute kidney injury-free days. I test was used to evaluate heterogeneity between studies. Substantial heterogeneity was defined as I greater than 50%. A random-effects model with Mantel-Haenszel weighting was used for all analyses. Heterogeneity was explored using subgroup analysis. The quality of evidence for intervention effects was summarized using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017054324). DATA SYNTHESIS: Three-thousand twenty-six potentially relevant studies were identified, and 30 articles were reviewed in full. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 2,833 individuals. Of these, 11 studies (2,691 individuals) were suitable for quantitative meta-analysis. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality. Patients who received vasopressin and its analogs had a reduced need for renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 0.59 [0.37-0.92]; p = 0.02; I = 49%) and a lower acute kidney injury incidence (odds ratio, 0.58 [0.37-0.92]; p = 0.02; I = 63%). These results should be interpreted with caution, due to excessive heterogeneity. Acute kidney injury-free data was not pooled, since the small number of studies and extreme heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with distributive shock, vasopressin and its analogs use is associated with a reduced need for renal replacement therapy and lower acute kidney injury incidence. These results are supported by high risk of bias evidence.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1304	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

DESIGN: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Cardiac surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals undergoing heart valve surgery. MEASUREMENTS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed reports of individuals undergoing heart valve surgery who underwent pre- and postoperative cognitive assessment. Our initial search returned 1,475 articles, of which 12 were included. Postoperative cognitive results were divided into those from 1 week to 1 month (early outcomes, npooled = 450) and from 2 to 6 months (intermediate outcomes; npooled = 722). No studies with longer-term outcomes were identified. RESULTS: Subjects had moderate early cognitive decline from baseline (Becker mean gain effect size (ES)=-0.39 +/- 0.27) that improved slightly by 2 to 6 months (ES=-0.25 +/- 0.38). Individuals undergoing aortic valve surgery-who were older on average than those undergoing mitral valve surgery (68 vs 57)-had greater early cognitive decline than those undergoing mitral valve surgery (ES=-0.68 vs -0.12), but both cohorts had similar decline 2 to 6 months postoperatively (ES=-0.27 vs -0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Heart valve surgery is associated with cognitive decline over the 6 months after surgery, but outcomes beyond 6 months are unclear. These findings highlight the cognitive vulnerability of this population, especially older adults with aortic stenosis. (c) 2018 American Geriatrics Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Surgery and chemotherapy are considered its mainstay of treatment and the completeness of surgery is a major prognostic factor for survival in these women. Currently, computed tomography (CT) is used to preoperatively assess tumour resectability. If considered feasible, women will be scheduled for primary debulking surgery (i.e. surgical efforts to remove the bulk of tumour with the aim of leaving no visible (macroscopic) tumour). If primary debulking is not considered feasible (i.e. the tumour load is too extensive), women will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy to reduce tumour load and subsequently undergo (interval) surgery. However, CT is imperfect in assessing tumour resectability, so additional imaging modalities can be considered to optimise treatment selection. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) PET/CT, conventional and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI as replacement or add-on to abdominal CT, for assessing tumour resectability at primary debulking surgery in women with stage III to IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Embase (OVID) for potential eligible studies (1946 to 23 February 2017). Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO-ICTRP and the reference list of all relevant studies were searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Diagnostic accuracy studies addressing the accuracy of preoperative FDG-PET/CT, conventional or DW-MRI on assessing tumour resectability in women with advanced stage (III to IV) epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer who are scheduled to undergo primary debulking surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance and inclusion, extracted data and performed methodological quality assessment using QUADAS-2. The limited number of studies did not permit meta-analyses. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies (544 participants) were included in the analysis. All studies performed the index test as replacement of abdominal CT. Two studies (366 participants) addressed the accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for assessing incomplete debulking with residual disease of any size (> 0 cm) with sensitivities of 1.0 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.0) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.73) and specificities of 1.0 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.0) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.93), respectively (low- and moderate-certainty evidence). Three studies (178 participants) investigated MRI for different target conditions, of which two investigated DW-MRI and one conventional MRI. The first study showed that DW-MRI determines incomplete debulking with residual disease of any size with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.98 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.00) (low- and moderate-certainty evidence). For abdominal CT, the sensitivity for assessing incomplete debulking was 0.66 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.78) and the specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) (low- and low-certainty evidence). The second study reported a sensitivity of DW-MRI of 0.75 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.97) and a specificity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.00) (very low-certainty evidence) for assessing incomplete debulking with residual disease > 1 cm. In the last study, the sensitivity for assessing incomplete debulking with residual disease of > 2 cm on conventional MRI was 0.91 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) and the specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.00) (very low-certainty evidence). Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low to moderate (according to GRADE), mainly due to small sample sizes and imprecision. AUTHORS` CONCLUSIONS: Studies suggested a high specificity and moderate sensitivity for FDG-PET/CT and MRI to assess macroscopic incomplete debulking. However, the certainty of the evidence was insufficient to advise routine addition of FDG-PET/CT or MRI to clinical practice..In a research setting, adding an alternative imaging method could be considered for women identified as suitable for primary debulking by abdominal CT, in an ttempt to filter out false-negatives (i.e. debulking, feasible based on abdominal CT, unfeasible at actual surgery).

Three separate, systematic literature searches identified 2,343 papers in total. Overall, 44 studies were included for data extraction and analysis. The included systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, were of good to very good quality (median Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire score = 17). Identified evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention services should consider regulation of blood glucose as a key target for intervention. Furthermore, the recommendations for effective intervention and service development/training described here for prevention of CVD should be adopted into evidence-based practice guidelines. Multidisciplinary teams should be formed to deliver multicomponent interventions in community-based settings. There may be substantial opportunities for integrating CVD and diabetes prevention services.		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1305	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Indicated preventive interventions for depression in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis and meta-regression	Ssegonja RN, C.  Feldman, I.  Sarkadi, A.  Langenskiold, S.  Jonsson, U.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	7-15-7-15	[EndPage]	Prev Med		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	118	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	Depression contributes about 2% to the global burden of disease. A first onset of depressive disorder or subsyndromal depressive symptoms is common in adolescence, indicating that early prevention is a priority. However, trials of preventive interventions for depression in youths show conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of group-based cognitive behavioral therapy (GB-CBT) as a preventive intervention targeting subsyndromal depression in children and adolescents. In addition, the impact of different covariates (type of comparator and use of booster sessions) was assessed. Relevant articles were identified from previous systematic reviews, and supplemented with an electronic search spanning from 01/09/2014 to 28/02/2018. The retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and risk of bias. Relevant data were extracted. Intervention effectiveness was pooled using a random-effects model and the impact of covariates assessed using meta-regression. 38 eligible articles (34 trials) were obtained. The analysis showed GB-CBT to significantly reduce the incidence (relative risk 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87) and symptoms (Cohen`s d -0.22, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.11) of depression at post-test compared to all controls. Comparisons with passive comparators suggested that the effect decayed over time. However, compared to active controls, a significant intervention effect was evident only after 12month or more. Our results suggest that the preventive effect of GB-CBT wears off, but still lasts longer than the effect of active comparators. Only a few studies included booster sessions, precluding firm conclusions. Future studies should clarify to what extent maintenance strategies can prolong the preventive effect of GB-CBT.

JOUR	[BLANK]	Nebulised hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis	Wark PM, V. M.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	CD001506-CD001506	[EndPage]	Cochrane Database Syst Rev		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	9	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: Impaired mucociliary clearance characterises lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hypertonic saline enhances mucociliary clearance and may lessen the destructive inflammatory process in the airways. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To investigate efficacy and tolerability of treatment with nebulised hypertonic saline on people with CF compared to placebo and or other treatments that enhance mucociliary clearance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched ongoing trials databases.Date of most recent searches: 08 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing hypertonic saline compared to placebo or other mucolytic therapy, for any duration or dose regimen in people with CF (any age or disease severity). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data, and assessed trial quality. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 17 trials (966 participants, aged 4 months to 63 years) were included; 19 trials were excluded, three trials are ongoing and 16 are awaiting classification. We judged 14 of the 17 included trials to have a high risk of bias due to participants ability to discern the taste of the solutions.Hypertonic saline 3% to 7% versus placeboAt four weeks, we found very low-quality evidence from three placebo-controlled trials (n = 225) that hypertonic saline (3% to 7%, 10 mL twice-daily) increased the mean change from baseline of the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) (% predicted) by 3.44% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 6.21), but there was no difference between groups in lung clearance index in one small trial (n = 10). By 48 weeks the effect was slightly smaller in one trial (n = 134), 2.31% (95% CI -2.72 to 7.34) (low-quality evidence). No deaths occurred in the trials. Two trials reporting data on exacerbations were not combined as the age difference between the participants in the trials was too great. One trial (162 adults) found 0.5 fewer exacerbations requiring antibiotics per person in the hypertonic saline group; the second trial (243 children, average age of two years) found no difference between groups (low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence reported across the trials to determine the rate of different adverse events such as cough, chest tightness, tonsillitis and vomiting (very low-quality evidence). Four trials (n = 80) found very low-quality evidence that sputum clearance was better with hypertonic saline.A further trial was performed in adults with an acute exacerbation of lung disease (n = 132). The effects of hypertonic saline on short-term lung function, 5.10% higher (14.67% lower to 24.87% higher) and the time to the subsequent exacerbation post-discharge, hazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.30) are uncertain (low-quality evidence). No deaths were reported. Cough and wheeze were reported but no serious adverse events (very low-quality evidence).Hypertonic saline versus mucus mobilising treatments Three trials compared a similar dose of hypertonic saline to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase); two (61 participants) provided data for inclusion in the review. There was insufficient evidence from one three-week trial (14 participants) to determine the effects of hypertonic saline on FEV1 % predicted, mean difference (MD) 1.60% (95% CI -7.96 to 11.16) (very low-quality evidence). In the second trial, rhDNase led to a greater increase in FEV1 % predicted than hypertonic saline (5 mL twice daily) at 12 weeks in participants with moderate to severe lung disease, MD 8.00% (95% CI 2.00 to 14.00) (low-quality evidence). One cross-over trial (47 participants) reported 15 exacerbations during treatment with hypertonic saline and 18 exacerb tions in the rhDNase group (low-quality evidence). Increased cough was reported in 13 participants using hypertonic saline and 17 on daily rhDNase in one cross-over trial of 47 people (low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to assess rates of other adverse events reported. No deaths were reported.One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to amiloride and one (29 participants) to sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate. Neither trial found a difference between treatments in any measures of sputum clearance; additionally the comparison of hypertonic saline and sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate reported no differences in courses of antibiotics or adverse events (very low-quality evidence).One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to mannitol but did not report lung function at relevant time points for this review; there were no differences in sputum clearance		[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	1318	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]
