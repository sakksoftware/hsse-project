Despite improvement of revascularization therapy, outcome in this population is poor affected by frailty of elderly patient. Aging is associated with a higher prevalence of below the knee disease and wound, often with diagnostic delay leading to a major rate of amputation, mortality and alteration of quality of life. Moreover, it leads to an important health cost for society. This review aims to describe main features of LEAD in the elderly, providing keys for early recognition and managing of such disease in this population.	10.1016/j.ancard.2018.10.004	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18584	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Within the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, countries committed to halve per-capita food waste generated at retail and consumer levels and to decrease food waste along the food supply chain by 2030. Reliable and detailed information on food waste is of utmost importance for the actors of the food supply chain, organizations and governments willing to implement and monitor effective reduction strategies. The present paper is a review of existing studies on food waste generation at the global and European scales and aims primarily at describing and comparing the approaches adopted, and secondarily at analysing their potential in supporting food waste related European interventions and policies. Ten studies were selected among relevant scientific papers and grey literature and their underlying quantification methodologies were systematically analysed. Methodological elements discussed in the paper include type of waste streams captured by estimations, distinction between edible and inedible food waste along the agro-food supply chain, reported units of measure, overall inefficiencies of the food system, and uncertainty of data. Current estimations of food loss and waste generation range between 194-389kg per person per year at the global scale, and between 158-298kg per person per year at the European scale. However, further efforts are needed to improve their level of detail and reliability and to foster their support to food loss and waste-related strategies.	10.1016/j.wasman.2018.07.032	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18585	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The definition of specific risk profiles, i.e. risk stratification, is of critical importance for the identification of these subgroups and thereby the targeting of care. Over the last few years large multicentre cohort studies have improved our knowledge regarding factors associated with progressive disease. Stratification based on biochemical response to ursodoxycholic acid provides a readily available measure to identify groups that might benefit from additional therapies to further improve prognosis. In addition, serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are now considered the most robustly validated biomarkers of long-term outcome in PBC and are used as endpoints in clinical trials. The GLOBE score and UK-PBC risk score enable us to quantify the risk of future events for the individual patient, allowing more individualized risk prediction. In this review, we discuss both established prognostic factors and newly developed tools to estimate prognosis in PBC, highlighting their strengths, limitations and applicability in clinical practice.	10.1016/j.bpg.2018.06.006	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18586	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

As patients are often asymptomatic, the disease may silently progress towards cirrhosis and liver failure. Timely diagnosis and effective treatment options are of vital importance to improve the prognosis of affected patients. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the standard of care first-line therapy and is associated with a reduced risk of liver transplantation and death. Treatment with UDCA is relevant for all patients, irrespective of disease stage or biochemical response. In case of incomplete biochemical response according to internationally accepted criteria, second-line treatment should be considered to improve long-term prognosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been the only accepted treatment for PBC during the last decades. Recent research, however, has identified a number of new therapeutic targets and agents, including obeticholic acid, fibrates and budesonide. While these agents all qualify as potentially beneficial second-line treatment, obeticholic acid is currently the only drug specifically approved for the treatment of PBC. Although long-term follow-up studies for these agents are mostly lacking, improvement of biochemical surrogate markers of clinical outcome induced by these drugs suggests a therapeutic benefit. The authors of this review aim to provide a summary of the results of previous and current studies evaluating medical treatments, and propose a treatment strategy based on the evidence available today.	10.1016/j.bpg.2018.06.004	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18587	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Because MD may have chronic and long-lasting effects, it is an important public health concern. The extent to which telemedicine may be an effective way to provide services to sufferers of MD is unknown, therefore, this review aimed to assess the available evidence. Methods We conducted a search of The Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for relevant randomised controlled trials published between 2000 and 2018; we then conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Results We identified 10 studies for inclusion. Therapeutic strategies involved cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural activation and other psychoeducation. Eight trials reported significant improvement in depression scores post-intervention; four studies that conducted post-intervention follow-up found that these improvements continued. However, high attrition rates and lack of blinding were common problems. Discussion This review found limited evidence supporting the delivery of CBT for the treatment of MD and anxiety using telemedicine. However, most of the evidence only studied improvements in postpartum depression, indicating that use of telemedicine to provide MD intervention is still small and an under-researched area.	10.1177/1357633x18794332	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18588	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Research shows that the availability of healthcare services pre and post bariatric surgery improves behavioural change and weight loss outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the evidence relating to the use of telemedicine for providing health services to bariatric surgery patients. Methods A search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycNET and SCOPUS. Original research relating to telemedicine for bariatric surgery patients published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Results Database search returned 258 references and a total of 10 studies were included in the review. Six studies assessed use, feasibility and acceptance of telemedicine by patients/practitioners. Studies also examined the use of telemedicine for weight loss, changes in physical activity, diet/eating or other behavioural changes. Two studies were randomised controlled trials; one showed a significant difference in outcomes between intervention and control group. Discussion This review suggests that telemedicine may be a potential method for providing healthcare services to bariatric surgery patients. However, the current evidence base does not allow for definitive conclusions.	10.1177/1357633x18795356	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18589	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Blood pressure variability  CBF autoregulation  Heart rate variability  Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity  Traumatic brain injury	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	BACKGROUND: The quantification and objective documentation of autonomic dysfunction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not well-studied nor extensively validated. Most of the description of autonomic dysfunction in the literature is in the form of vague non-specific clinical manifestations. Few studies proposed the use of objective measures of assessing the extent of autonomic dysfunction to link them to the outcome of TBI. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to perform a scoping systematic review of the literature on the objective documentation of autonomic dysfunction in terms of functional and physiological variables to be linked to outcome of TBI. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, BIOSIS, Scopus, Embase Cochrane Libraries and GlobalHealth databases were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the results. Full texts for citations passing this initial screen were obtained. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to each article to obtain final articles for review. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2619 citations. Of 69 articles selected for final review, 14 were chosen based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be included in the results of this paper. 9 of these articles assessed autonomic dysfunction using functional variables and 7 using physiological variables. Some studies included both functional and physiological variables. Of the 9 studies linked autonomic dysfunction to functional variables, 9 included heart rate variability (HRV), 3 included baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and 2 included blood pressure variability (BPV). A total of 2714 adult patients were studied. CONCLUSIONS: Although the nature of link between autonomic dysfunction and outcome is unclear, the objective quantification of autonomic dysfunction seems to be associated with global patient outcome and other neurophysiologic measures. Further studies are needed to validate its use and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of the described associations.	10.1089/neu.2018.6073	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18590	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the primary source of stem cells used in the majority of both pre-clinical and clinical studies in stroke. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines on the use of SCT in stroke patients, understanding the progress of MSC research across published studies will assist researchers and clinicians in better achieving success in translating research. We conducted a systematic review on published literature using MSCs in both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials between 2008 and 2017 using the public databases PubMed and Ovid Medline, and the clinical trial registry ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ). A total of 78 pre-clinical studies and eight clinical studies were identified. While majority of the pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrated statistically significant effects, the clinical significance of these findings was still unclear. Effect sizes could not be measured mainly due to reporting issues in pre-clinical studies, thus limiting our ability to compare results across studies quantitatively. The overall quality of both pre-clinical and clinical studies was sub-optimal. By conducting a systematic review of both pre-clinical and clinical studies on MSCs therapy in stroke, we assessed the quality of current evidence and identified several issues and gaps in translating animal studies to human trials. Addressing these issues and incorporating changes into future animal studies and human trials may lead to better success of stem cells-based therapeutics in the near future.	10.1177/0963689718806846	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18591	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) research practice regarding control conditions that are neither usual care nor no-treatment controls in randomized trials of psychoeducational palliative care interventions and (2) the rationale and completeness of the descriptions of control conditions in trial reports. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched. After screening 1603 articles, 70 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. The final sample included 9 trial reports. We used the Delphi list for quality assessment and the modified intervention taxonomy checklist to assess active intervention and control conditions. RESULTS: Four trials used an attention control designed to be equivalent to the structure of the active intervention. In another 4, the control condition included some aspects of attention control such that the mode of contact was similar to that in the active intervention, but either the amount or the intensity of attention was not similar. Only 3 trial reports explicitly stated the rationale for the choice of control condition. Although most reports contained delivery mode, materials, duration, frequency, and sequence, none described the qualifications or training required to deliver the control condition. Only 1 report mentioned the fidelity monitoring method, and none included fidelity data. CONCLUSION: Our review of psychoeducational trials in palliative care calls for researchers' attention to appropriate selection, design, conduct and report of control conditions.	10.1177/1049909118805936	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18592	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The percentage contribution matrix, which shows how much each direct treatment effect contributes to each treatment effect estimate from network meta-analysis, is crucial in this context. We use ideas from graph theory to derive the percentage that is contributed by each direct treatment effect. We start with the 'projection' matrix in a two-step network meta-analysis model, called the H matrix, which is analogous to the hat matrix in a linear regression model. We develop a method to translate H entries to percentage contributions based on the observation that the rows of H can be interpreted as flow networks, where a stream is defined as the composition of a path and its associated flow. We present an algorithm that identifies the flow of evidence in each path and decomposes it into direct comparisons. To illustrate the methodology, we use two published networks of interventions. The first compares no treatment, quinolone antibiotics, non-quinolone antibiotics and antiseptics for underlying eardrum perforations and the second compares 14 antimanic drugs. We believe that this approach is a useful and novel addition to network meta-analysis methodology, which allows the consistent derivation of the percentage contributions of direct evidence from individual studies to network treatment effects.	10.12688/f1000research.14770.2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18593	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

OBJECTIVES: To review the contraceptive efficacy during extended use of progestin implants. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for articles in any language, 1996-2017, utilizing terms for devices and contraceptive efficacy. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies were included; abstracts, posters, and presentations were excluded. Studies evaluating Norplant and implants currently in pre-marketing trials were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts of articles were reviewed; those that met inclusion and exclusion criteria underwent full text review and data abstraction. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 2951 articles; six met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five studies evaluated the etonogestrel implant (Implanon), and one the levonorgestrel implant (Jadelle). One RCT randomized to method, not duration; the remaining studies were prospective cohort studies. Three studies analyzed efficacy among women beyond currently approved duration separately. All studies were of poor to fair quality by United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPTF) grading. Limitations include lack of generalizability and control of important confounders.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted. OBJECTIVES: To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short-term measurements (defined as less than three months follow-up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study).Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias.We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate-to-severe eczema after short-term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low-quality evidence).When short-term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate-to-severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (mean improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain.All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low.No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low-quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long-term control.We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low-quality evidence).There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate-to-severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all.Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance.	10.1002/14651858.CD011224.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18595	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

This equilibrium is regulated by numerous cytokines, but it has been largely demonstrated that the RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways play a key role in the control of osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, respectively. The pro-osteoblastogenic activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin can be inhibited by sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1). RANKL, sclerostin and DKKs-1 are often up-regulated in bone diseases, and they are the target of new monoclonal antibodies. DATA SOURCES: The authors performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE to June 2018, reviewed and selected articles, based on pre-determined selection criteria. RESULTS: We re-evaluated the role of RANKL, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin and DKK-1 in altered bone remodeling associated with some inherited and acquired pediatric diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), alkaptonuria (AKU), hemophilia A, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OH-D) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). To do so, we considered recent clinical studies done on pediatric patients in which the roles of RANKL-RANK/osteoprotegerin and WNT-ss-catenin signaling pathways have been investigated, and for which innovative therapies for the treatment of osteopenia/osteoporosis are being developed. CONCLUSIONS: The case studies taken into account for this review demonstrated that quite frequently both bone reabsorbing and bone deposition are impaired in pediatric diseases. Furthermore, for some of them, bone damage began in childhood but only manifested with age. The use of denosumab could represent a valid alternative therapeutic approach to improve bone health in children, although further studies need to be carried out.	10.1007/s12519-018-0198-7	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18596	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, the efficacy and the safety of LB ablation in comparison to CB ablation remained indeterminate. We sought to compare these two technologies by conducting meta-analysis of previous studies using both the CB and LB ablation systems for AF ablation. METHODS: We searched electronic scientific databases for studies of LB vs. CB ablation in AF patients. The procedural efficacy was assessed by the success of acute pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and the 12-month recurrence of any atrial arrhythmia, and the safety was evaluated by the risk of procedure-related complications. RESULTS: A total of 595 participants (LB, n = 292 vs. CB, n = 303) from eight studies were included in this meta-analysis. Risk of acute PVI failure (risk ratio, RR 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.55 [0.86-7.56], P = 0.09) and atrial arrhythmia recurrence in 12 months (RR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.64-1.28], P = 0.59) were comparable between LB vs. CB ablation, and LB ablation tended to be more effective than CB ablation in paroxysmal AF patients (RR [95% CI] = 0.70 [0.47-1.03], P = 0.07). Risk of procedure-related complications was similar while LB ablation showed slightly higher risk without statistic significance (LB 13.9% vs. CB 9.3%, RR [95% CI] = 1.52 [0.88-2.64], P = 0.14). Compared with CB ablation, LB ablation led to longer procedure duration (weighted mean differences WMD [95% CI] =29.7 [15.8-43.7], P < 0.001) while similar fluoroscopy duration was observed between these two ablation devices (WMD [95% CI] = - 1.99[- 6.46-2.47], P = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: LB ablation has a trend toward higher procedural efficacy compared with CB ablation in paroxysmal AF patients. However, longer procedure duration and a statistically non-significant trend of more procedure-related complications were also observed in patients ablated by LB. Further larger comparative randomized trials are warranted to disclose the impact of LB compared with CB for ablation of AF.	10.1007/s10840-018-0474-4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18597	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Highlights of the Recent Literature	Real MB, M. S.  Higley, C.  Rosenberg, J.  Lewis, J.

Knowledge regarding responsible drugs, mechanisms, risk factors, and the diagnostic tools to detect liver injury have continued to grow in the past year. This review highlights what we considered the most significant publications from among more than 1800 articles relating to liver injury from medications, herbal products, and dietary supplements in 2017 and 2018. The US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) prospective study highlighted several areas of ongoing study, including the potential utility of human leukocyte antigens and microRNAs as DILI risk factors and new data on racial differences, the role of alcohol consumption, factors associated with prognosis, and updates on the clinical signatures of autoimmune DILI, thiopurines, and HDS agents. Novel data were also generated from the Spanish and Latin American DILI registries as well as from Chinese and Korean case series. A few new agents causing DILI were added to the growing list in the past 2 years, including sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, as were new aspects of chemotherapy-associated liver injury. A number of cases reported previously described hepatotoxins confirmed via the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM; e.g., norethisterone, methylprednisolone, glatiramer acetate) and/or the DILIN method (e.g., celecoxib, dimethyl fumarate). Additionally, much work centered on elucidating the pathophysiology of DILI, including the importance of bile salt export pumps and immune-mediated mechanisms. Finally, it must be noted that, while hundreds of new studies described DILI in 2017-2018, the quality of such reports must always be addressed. Bjornsson reminds us to remain very critical of the data when addressing the future utility of a study, which is why it is so important to adhere to a standardized method such as RUCAM when determining DILI causality. While drug-induced hepatotoxicity remains a diagnosis of exclusion, the diverse array of publications that appeared in 2017 and 2018 provided important advances in our understanding of DILI, paving the way for our improved ability to make a more definitive diagnosis and risk assessment.	10.1007/s40264-018-0743-2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18598	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Emerging evidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms may contribute to differential symptom susceptibility. We aimed to systematically review associations between genetic polymorphisms and PN symptoms during or after cancer treatment for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Twenty-six eligible articles published until October 2017 were identified in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and additional records. Information on study characteristics, genetic polymorphisms, and PN symptoms was extracted. Study quality was evaluated by the STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association (STREGA) guideline. Genes included in the analysis were categorized by biological pathways based on the Reactome database. RESULTS: A total of 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes that are significantly associated with PN symptoms were identified; half of them were associated with increased severity of PN symptoms, while the other half contributed to the decrease of PN symptoms. Pain has the known highest number of associated genetic polymorphisms reported, followed by fatigue, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. The majority of genetic polymorphisms were involved in immune system and neuronal system pathways. Most studies were unsuccessful in meeting the STREGA guideline, which requires transparent reporting of methods and results. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides comprehensive evidence of genetic polymorphisms underlying PN symptoms, which may pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics targeting these symptoms. More well-designed genome-wide association studies are required to validate and replicate these findings.	10.1007/s00520-018-4508-3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18599	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Psychosocial functioning has also been noted to improve for most patients after bariatric surgery. However, some studies have shown an increase in post-operative suicide risk. The aim of this study was to review the published literature and evaluate the association of bariatric surgery with suicide events and suicide/self-harm attempts in patients who have undergone weight loss surgery. METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were searched from inception through January 2018 for retrospective or prospective studies reporting mortality outcomes and self-harm or suicide rates after bariatric procedures. The primary outcome was the pooled event rate with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for suicide. Secondary outcomes were suicide/self-harm attempts after bariatric surgery compared to same population prior to surgery and to matched control subjects, with the respective calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. RESULTS: From 227 citations, 32 studies with 148,643 subjects were eligible for inclusion. The patients were predominantly females (76.9%). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was the most commonly performed procedure (58.9%). The post-bariatric suicide event rate was 2.7/1000 patients (95% CI 0.0019-0.0038), while the suicide/self-harm attempt event rate was 17/1000 patients (95% CI 0.01-0.03). The self-harm/suicide attempt risk was higher after bariatric surgery within the same population with OR of 1.9 (95% CI 1.23-2.95), and compared to matched control subjects, OR 3.8 (95% CI, 2.19-6.59). CONCLUSIONS: Post-bariatric surgery patients had higher self-harm/suicide attempt risk compared to age-, sex-, and BMI-matched controls. Various pre- and post-surgical psychosocial, pharmacokinetic, physiologic, and medical factors may be involved.	10.1007/s11695-018-3493-4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18600	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, we do not have a complete understanding of the cellular mechanisms that govern dietary phosphate absorption. Studies in the 1970s documented both active and passive pathways for intestinal phosphate absorption. However, following the cloning of the intestinal SLC34 cotransporter, NaPi-IIb, much of the research focused on the role of this protein in active transcellular phosphate absorption and the factors involved in its regulation. Generation of a conditional NaPi-IIb knockout mouse has demonstrated that this protein is critical for the maintenance of skeletal integrity during periods of phosphate restriction and that under normal physiological conditions, the passive sodium-independent pathway is likely be the more dominant pathway for intestinal phosphate absorption. The review aims to summarise the most recent developments in our understanding of the role of the intestine in phosphate homeostasis, including the acute and chronic renal adaptations that occur in response to dietary phosphate intake. Evidence regarding the overall contribution of the transcellular and paracellular pathways for phosphate absorption will be discussed, together with the clinical benefit of inhibiting these pathways for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease.	10.1007/s00424-018-2221-1	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18601	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze the effect of MBP on the incidence of postoperative complications; anastomotic leakage, intra-abdominal infection, and wound infection, following colorectal surgery in pediatric patients. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched to compare the effect of MBP versus no MBP prior to elective pediatric colorectal surgery on postoperative complications. After critical appraisal of included studies, meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effect model. RESULTS: 1731 papers were retrieved; 2 randomized controlled trials and 4 retrospective cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality of evidence was low. MBP before colorectal surgery did not significantly decrease the occurrence of anastomotic leakage, intra-abdominal infection, or wound infection compared to no MBP. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the existing evidence, the use of MBP before colorectal surgery in children seems not to decrease the incidence of postoperative complications compared to no MBP. To overcome confounding factors such as antibiotic prophylaxis, age and type of operation, a multicentre prospective study is suggested to validate these results.	10.1007/s00383-018-4345-y	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18602	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Worldwide many treatment protocols are used with variable success rates. Awareness on the need of standardized, evidence-based guidelines has increased in recent years. This systematic literature review gives an overview of available diagnostic criteria, classifications, treatment protocols, and related outcome measurements for surgically treated FRI patients. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in all scientific literature since 1990. Studies in English that described surgical patient series for treatment of FRI were included. Data were collected on diagnostic criteria for FRI, classifications used, surgical treatments, follow-up protocols, and overall outcome. A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA statement. Proportions and weighted means were calculated. RESULTS: The search yielded 2051 studies. Ninety-three studies were suitable for inclusion, describing 3701 patients (3711 fractures) with complex FRI. The population consisted predominantly of male patients (77%), with the tibia being the most commonly affected bone (64%), and a mean of three previous operations per patient. Forty-three (46%) studies described FRI at one specific location. Only one study (1%) used a standardized definition for infection. A total of nine different classifications were used to guide treatment protocols, of which Cierny and Mader was used most often (36%). Eighteen (19%) studies used a one-stage, 50 (54%) a two-stage, and seven (8%) a three-stage surgical treatment protocol. Ten studies (11%) used mixed protocols. Antibiotic protocols varied widely between studies. A multidisciplinary approach was mentioned in only 12 (13%) studies. CONCLUSIONS: This extensive literature review shows a lack of standardized guidelines with respect to diagnosis and treatment of FRI, which mimics the situation for prosthetic joint infection identified many years ago. Internationally accepted guidelines are urgently required to improve the quality of care for patients suffering from this significant complication.	10.1007/s00402-018-3048-0	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18603	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

There are currently several rehabilitative options and strategies, and it is crucial to find the most effective interventions. The applicability of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the recovery of nonmotor functions such as communication skills, swallowing ability and spatial attention after stroke remains important clinical questions. SUMMARY: We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science for articles that used repetitive TMS protocols to rehabilitate post-stroke deficits. We analysed qualitatively 38 articles that met the eligibility criteria; of these, 21 dealt with aphasia, 8 with dysphagia, 8 with neglect and 1 with visual extinction. The efficacy of TMS as an intervention for post-stroke rehabilitation of these nonmotor deficits was studied as well as the current limitations were assessed. Key Messages: Most part of the included studies reported statistically significant functional improvements, supporting the use of TMS for the rehabilitation of aphasia, dysphagia and neglect. Future research, with larger sample sizes, is mandatory to confirm its efficacy, determine the optimal stimulation parameters and investigate inter-subject variability.	10.1159/000494213	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18604	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis showed that rs1800871 was associated with an increased periodontitis risk under dominant model (CT + TT vs. CC: p = 0.004, OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.21-2.65) in Latin American populations but not in Asian (CT + TT vs. CC: p = 0.229, OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.58-1.14) and Caucasian (CT + TT vs. CC: p = 0.910, OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.75-1.39) populations. Similarly, rs1800872 conferred an increased risk of periodontitis only in Latin American populations (CA + AA vs. CC: p = 0.012, OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.20-4.47; A allele vs. C allele: p = 0.001, OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.22-2.14). No significant association was observed between rs1800896 and periodontitis risk. Subgrouping data according to periodontitis type revealed that rs1800872 was associated with both chronic periodontitis (A allele vs. C allele: p = 0.011, OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.13-2.62) and aggressive periodontitis (A allele vs. C allele: p = 0.038, OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.02-1.72). CONCLUSION: The studies reviewed support that the IL-10 rs1800871 and rs1800872 polymorphisms may represent a potential genetic biomarker for periodontitis risk in Latin American populations.	10.1016/j.archoralbio.2018.10.012	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18605	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The only treatment option is based on the early identification of at-risk patients. The number of reported risk factors for BKPyV reactivation has increased markedly in the literature last years, although they are sometimes in an unclear or contradictory manner. Our purpose is to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for BKPyV viremia and nephropathy described in multivariate analyses. The PubMed database was searched for prospective or prospectively-based observational studies on risk factors for BKPyV viremia and/or nephropathy. Our qualitative assessment of risk factors was based on the odds ratios and hazard ratios calculated in multivariate regression analyses. Of the 241 publications screened, 34 were included in the qualitative analysis. In all, 144 and 19 distinct factors were analyzed for BKPyV viremia and for BKPyV nephropathy, respectively. Our evaluation highlighted eight risk factors for BKPyV viremia: a tacrolimus regimen, a deceased donor, a male recipient, a history of previous transplant, age at transplantation, ureteral stent use, delayed graft function, and acute rejection episodes increased the risk of BKV viremia to varying extents. Tacrolimus and acute rejection episodes were also associated with a higher incidence of BKPyV nephropathy. BKPyV reactivation is a serious complication after renal transplantation. With a view to combating this problem, existing data should be published in full, and new prospective international multicenter studies should be performed.	10.1016/j.jcv.2018.10.002	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18606	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Approaches to diagnosis include using mnemonics and clinical reasoning. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this review was to assess the degree to which the criteria researchers use to evaluate diagnostic performance in pharmacy consultations, in studies that have simulated patients or vignettes, conform with a clinical reasoning and a mnemonic framework. A secondary aim of the review was to characterize staff performance in the studies, based on the authors' comments of their results. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched between October 2016 and April 2017. Only peer-reviewed studies assessing pharmacy staff's diagnostic performance using simulated patients or vignettes were eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted about how each study's criteria conformed with clinical reasoning and mnemonic frameworks. A scoring system between 0 and 4 was devised to determine the degree to which studies aligned to these two approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using the NHI Study Quality Assessment Tools. The review was registered in PROSPERO with identification number CRD42017054827. RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies (55 cross-sectional, 11 educational interventions and 2 RCTs) with sample sizes between 10 and 2700 were included in the review. Most studies were of poor or fair quality. Performance of pharmacy staff was overwhelmingly reported as poor by study authors. This was the case regardless of geography, scenario used, or assessment framework adopted. Scrutiny on how authors arrived at these conclusions revealed that mnemonic criteria were employed to assess pharmacy staff's diagnostic performance rather than a clinical reasoning approach. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially important aspects of the decision-making process, such as clinical reasoning, were left unexplored. The number and geographic distribution of the included studies is a strength of this review; however, a validated tool was not employed.	10.1016/j.sapharm.2018.10.003	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18609	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the existing literature on BCR after treatment with curative intent for nonmetastatic PCa. Objective 1 is to investigate whether oncological outcomes differ between patients with or without BCR. Objective 2 is to study which clinical factors and tumor features in patients with BCR have an independent prognostic impact on oncological outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. For objective 1, prospective and retrospective studies comparing survival outcomes of patients with or without BCR following radical prostatectomy (RP) or radical radiotherapy (RT) were included. For objective 2, all studies with at least 100 participants and reporting on prognostic patient and tumor characteristics in patients with BCR were included. Risk-of-bias and confounding assessments were performed according to the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Both a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis were undertaken. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, 77 studies were included for analysis, of which 14 addressed objective 1, recruiting 20 406 patients. Objective 2 was addressed by 71 studies with 29 057, 11 301, and 4272 patients undergoing RP, RT, and a mixed population (mix of patients undergoing RP or RT as primary treatment), respectively. There was a low risk of bias for study participation, confounders, and statistical analysis. For most studies, attrition bias, and prognostic and outcome measurements were not clearly reported. BCR was associated with worse survival rates, mainly in patients with short prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) and a high final Gleason score after RP, or a short interval to biochemical failure (IBF) after RT and a high biopsy Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: BCR has an impact on survival, but this effect appears to be limited to a subgroup of patients with specific clinical risk factors. Short PSA-DT and a high final Gleason score after RP, and a short IBF after RT and a high biopsy Gleason score are the main factors that have a negative impact on survival. These factors may form the basis of new BCR risk stratification (European Association of Urology BCR Risk Groups), which needs to be validated formally. PATIENT SUMMARY: This review looks at the risk of death in men who shows rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood test performed after curative surgery or radiotherapy. For many men, rising PSA does not mean that they are at a high risk of death from prostate cancer in the longer term. Men with PSA that rises shortly after they were treated with radiotherapy or rapidly rising PSA after surgery and a high tumor grade for both treatment modalities are at the highest risk of death. These factors may form the basis of new risk stratification (European Association of Urology biochemical recurrence Risk Groups), which needs to be validated formally.	10.1016/j.eururo.2018.10.011	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18610	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Although traditional implants have been loosely fixed, smooth stemmed implants functioning more as spacers, modern designs have introduced press-fit, tapered implants that articulate at the capitellum with more rigidly maintained congruity. Cemented implants also use rigid initial fixation. This study was conducted to help determine which fixation method results in better functional outcomes: "fixed" or "unfixed." METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was used. We identified 63 articles via 3 databases. Ten non-English or articles with insufficient text were excluded, and 17 others did not contain sufficient data or follow-up. The remaining 36 articles were qualitatively and quantitatively reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 36 populations, with 878 unduplicated patients: 522 fixed and 356 unfixed. Respectively, mean follow-up in months was 46.2 and 37.4. Average Mayo Elbow Performance Scores were 85.9 and 88.2 (P = .08). Average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores were 17.1 and 18.7 (P = .47). Average final flexion/extension arcs were 119.1 degrees and 115.8 degrees (P = .08). Revision rates were 7.9% and 3.1%, and complication rates were 25.5% and 13.2%. Relative risks of revision and complications for the fixed cohort were 2.48 (P = .006) and 1.88 (P < 0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Implant fixation type does not appear to affect functional outcomes of radial head arthroplasty. However, rigidly fixing the implant may increase the risks of revision and complications.	10.1016/j.jse.2018.07.032	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18611	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The lower mortality among patients undergoing emergency EVAR under local anesthesia (LA) observed in the Immediate Management of Patients with Rupture: Open Versus Endovascular Repair trial has sparked renewed interest in the anesthesia choice for EVAR. This systematic review evaluates the effect of mode of anesthesia on outcomes after EVAR. DESIGN: The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The primary outcome was in-hospital/30-day mortality, and both emergency and elective EVAR were included. The relative risk of death was estimated for each individual study without adjustment for potential confounding factors. SETTING: Hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39,744 patients from 22 nonrandomized studies were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies in 23,202 patients compared LA to general anesthesia (GA) and reported in-hospital/30-day mortality. The unadjusted risk of death after emergency EVAR with LA was lower than with GA. Trends in elective surgery were less clear. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence across both emergency and elective settings to suggest that mode of anesthesia may be associated with improved outcomes. In particular, LA appears to have a positive effect on outcome after emergency EVAR. Because of the lack of randomized trial data, a significant risk of confounding remains. The optimal mode of anesthesia for EVAR should be investigated further and the reasons why particular anesthesia techniques are chosen for particular patients identified.	10.1053/j.jvca.2018.09.018	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18612	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies that evaluated outcomes of both transverse and oblique USO for UIS. Level of evidence was determined by 2 independent reviewers. Studies were screened based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A total of 37 studies (1,423 patients) were included in final analysis. The average rate of nonunion and delayed union for each group (transverse and oblique osteotomy) was calculated. RESULTS: The average rate of nonunion among all osteotomies was 4.0%. The average rate of nonunion was 4.16% and 3.86% in transverse osteotomies and oblique osteotomies, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. The average rate of delayed union, in those studies that reported delayed union, was 5.7%. The average rate of delayed union was 7.41% and 4.1% in transverse osteotomies and oblique osteotomies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our review of the literature, there is no difference in the rate of nonunion between transverse and oblique osteotomies. Therefore, the decision of which of the 2 surgical techniques should not be based on rate of nonunion.

A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (3) In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (eg, provocative, stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (4) Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.	10.1016/j.annemergmed.2018.07.045	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18614	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The BYOD policy is also perceived as a driver for balancing user needs for convenience with institutional needs for security. However, there seems to be a paucity in the literature on BYOD policy development, policy evaluation, and evaluation of mobile device implementation projects. OBJECTIVE: This review explored the literature to identify BYOD policy components (issues, interventions, and guidelines) that could potentially inform BYOD policy development and implementation in medical schools and healthcare facilities. METHODS: A literature search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Ebscohost (Academic Search Premier, ERIC, CINAHL, and MEDLINE) was conducted using the following search terms and their synonyms: healthcare facilities, mobile devices, BYOD, privacy and confidentiality, and health records. We developed a review matrix to capture the main aspects of each article and coded the matrix for emerging themes. The database and hand search yielded 1 594 articles, 14 of which were deemed as meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Several themes emerging from the analysis include: device management, data security, medical applications, information technology, education and/or curriculum, policy, and guidelines. The guidelines theme seems to provide a direction for BYOD policy development and implementation while the policy theme seems to be the comprehensive solution that synergizes BYOD implementation. CONCLUSION: Rather than an approach of 'chasing' issues with interventions, a more feasible approach towards achieving a safe mobile device use environment is through the development of comprehensive BYOD policies that would balance users' need for convenience with organizational security and patient privacy. The paucity in peer-reviewed literature calls for robust research that uses socio-technical approaches to development and evaluation of BYOD policies in medical schools and healthcare facilities.	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.09.013	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18615	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Pregnancies with end-age vascular complications are a big challenge to multidisciplinary physicians. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of microangiopathy for adverse pregnancy outcome in T1DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles appearing in the literature up to October 1, 2017. Analysis of cohort studies were performed with Review Manager 5.3 and Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was chosen to evaluate the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies involving 3239 pregnancies were retrieved and analyzed. Microangiopathy for diabetic nephropathy (DN), microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy (DR) significantly increased the risk of preeclampsia (PE) (OR of 7.19, [95%CI: 5.15, 10.03], 4.19, [95%CI: 2.78, 6.31] and 3.02, [95%CI: 2.24, 4.07], respectively). Significant association of the presence of DN with preterm delivery was demonstrated (OR = 4.14, 95%CI [2.84, 6.02]), with small for gestation age was demonstrated (OR = 6.23, 95%CI [2.75, 14.14]) and with large for gestation age was demonstrated (OR = 0.41, 95%CI [0.27, 0.62]). A mild association of the presence of DR with preterm delivery was demonstrated (OR = 1.57, 95%CI [1.08, 2.29]). CONCLUSION: The presence of microangiopathy before or in early pregnancy increased the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in T1DM. We highlighted it was important that White's classification and a full assessment of vasculopathy should be carry out before pregnancy to ensure a well-planned pregnancy. Further work should be designed to establish risks model involving microangiopathy and find out whether early intervention with strict blood sugar control or medication such as low-dose aspirin will reduce the incidence of PE in T1DM.	10.1016/j.tjog.2018.08.008	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18616	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The current research was aimed at reviewing the psychological interventions that are implemented to treat the aforementioned conditions. Vocabulary from the Medical Subject Headings database was used as basis for identifying search keywords, which were then employed to search for relevant articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Scientific Information Database, IranMedex, Magiran, and IranDoc. A total of 174,270 articles published in the period between 1985 and 2017 were obtained. After the elimination of repetitive and unrelated articles, six clinical trials were evaluated using the Oxford quality scoring system or Jadad scale. Psychological interventions for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy fall into four categories, namely, behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, hypnosis, and progressive muscle relaxation. On the basis of the Jadad scale, all the reviewed studies were evaluated as being of poor methodological quality. Further studies are needed to obtain strong evidence on the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the treatment of women suffering from nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.	10.1016/j.tjog.2018.08.005	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18617	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

To avoid the underdiagnosis of lymph node metastasis, pelvic lymphadenectomy procedure is routinely performed with radical hysterectomy procedure. However, the pelvic lymphadenectomy procedure may not be necessary in most of these women due to the relatively low incidence of pelvic lymph node metastasis. The removal of large numbers of pelvic lymph nodes could also render non-metastatic irreversible damages for these women, including vessel, nerve, or ureteral injuries; formation of lymphocysts; and lymphedema. Over the past decades, the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy has emerged as a popular and widespread surgical technique for the evaluation of the pelvic lymph node status in gynecologic malignancies. The histological status of sentinel lymph node should be representative for all other lymph nodes in the regional drainage area. If metastasis is non-existent in the sentinel lymph node, the likelihood of metastatic spread in the remaining regional lymph nodes is very low. Further lymphadenectomy is therefore not necessary for a patient with negative sentinel lymph nodes. Since the uterine cervix has several lymphatic drainage pathways, it is a challenging task to assess the distribution pattern of sentinel lymph nodes in women with early-stage cervical cancer. This review article will adapt the methodology proposed in these studies to systematically review sentinel lymphatic mapping among women with early-stage cervical cancer.	10.1016/j.tjog.2018.08.004	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18618	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, an important sequel to lymphadenectomy procedure is the possible occurrence of lymphedema in the lower abdomen and lower extremities. Previous researches also find that women with lymphedema experience many emotional impacts, including depression, anxiety, and adjustment problems. Only approximately 10% of women with clinical stage IB cervical carcinoma were involved with metastatic disease. If we could better define the relevant lymphatic nodes that must be removed, it is then possible to limit routinely performed lymphadenectomy for regional nodal metastasis in the pelvis, and hence reduce the need for extended surgical staging (para-aortic lymphadenectomy). We systematically reviewed a body of literature and updated available information concerning the current progress on the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy in women with early-stage cervical cancer. All detection methods (preoperative injection of radiocolloid tracer, intraoperative injection of blue dye, or a combination of both techniques) demonstrated reasonable sensitivity (with a few exceptions), high specificity, low false-negative rate and high negative predictive value. The review of the literature in this paper should convince the readers that sentinel lymph node biopsy has the potential to improve the quality of life and the possibility to maintain relapse-free survival for women with cervical cancer. The proper identification of negative sentinel lymph node allows individualized therapy and may preclude the need of lymphadenectomy procedure in most of these women.	10.1016/j.tjog.2018.08.003	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18619	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The objective of this study was to update two prior systematic reviews assessing the impact of community education and engagement interventions on family planning outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Sixteen electronic databases were searched for studies relevant to a priori determined inclusion/exclusion criteria in high development settings, published from March 2011 through April 2016, updating two reviews that included studies from 1985 through February 2011. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Nine relevant studies were included in this updated review related to community education, in addition to 17 from the prior review. No new community engagement studies met inclusion criteria, as occurred in the prior review. Of new studies, community education modalities included mass media, print/mail, web-based, text messaging, and interpersonal interventions. One study on mass media intervention demonstrated a positive impact on reducing teen and unintended pregnancies. Three of four studies on interpersonal interventions demonstrated positive impacts on medium-term family planning outcomes, such as contraception and condom use. Three new studies demonstrated mostly positive, but inconsistent, results on short-term family planning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this systematic review update are in line with a previous review showing the positive impact of community education using traditional modalities on short-term family planning outcomes, identifying additional impacts on long-term outcomes, and highlighting new evidence for education using modern modalities, such as text messaging and web-based education. More research is necessary to provide a stronger evidence base for directing community education and engagement efforts in family planning contexts.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Multiple databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1985 to April 2016 that included key terms related to adolescent reproductive health services. Analysis of these studies occurred in 2017. Studies were excluded if they focused solely on sexually transmitted disease/HIV prevention services, or occurred outside of a clinic setting or the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. Inclusion and exclusion criteria further narrowed the studies to those that included information on at least one short-term (e.g., increased knowledge); medium-term (e.g., increased contraceptive use); or long-term (e.g., decreased repeat teen pregnancy) outcome, or identified contextual barriers or facilitators for providing adolescent-focused family planning services. Standardized abstraction methods and tools were used to synthesize the evidence and assess its quality. Only studies of clinic-based programs focused on repeat teen pregnancy prevention were included in this review. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The search strategy identified 27,104 citations, 940 underwent full-text review, and 120 met the adolescent-focused family planning services inclusion criteria. Only five papers described clinic-based programs focused on repeat teen pregnancy prevention. Four studies found positive (n=2) or null (n=2) effects on repeat teen pregnancy prevention; an additional study described facilitators for helping teen mothers remain linked to services. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified clinic-based repeat teen pregnancy prevention programs and few positively affect factors that may reduce repeat teen pregnancy. Access to immediate postpartum contraception or home visiting programs may be opportunities to meet adolescents where they are and reduce repeat teen pregnancy.

A systematic review conducted in 2011 was updated in 2016 to incorporate recent data examining the effects of youth-friendly family planning services on reproductive health outcomes and the facilitators and barriers facing young people in accessing family planning services. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, POPLINE, EMBASE, and other databases were used to identify relevant articles published from March 2011 through April 2016. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria and were added to 19 studies from the review conducted in 2011. Of these, seven assessed the effect of youth-friendly services on outcomes: two showed a positive effect on reducing teen pregnancy, three on contraceptive use, and three on knowledge and patient satisfaction (not mutually exclusive). Facilitators or barriers were described in 32 studies. However, none were RCTs and most were at high risk for bias due to selection, self-report, and recall bias among others. CONCLUSIONS: The studies in this review suggest some positive effects of youth-friendly family planning services on reproductive health outcomes, but the need for more rigorous research persists. This review identified numerous factors relevant to young people's access to family planning services, reaffirming findings from the initial review: young people value confidentiality, supportive provider interaction, specialized provider training, and the removal of logistic barriers. Further, it illuminates the importance young people place on receiving comprehensive, client-centered family planning counseling. These findings should be considered when developing, implementing, and evaluating reproductive health services for young people.

Of three studies (including two RCTs) that examined reminder systems among depot medroxyprogesterone acetate users, one of three that examined correct use found a statistically significant positive impact on timely injections at 3 months, and one study found no effect on continued use at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although this review found mixed support for the effectiveness of reminder systems on family planning behaviors, the highest quality evidence yielded null findings related to correct use of oral contraception and timely depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections beyond 3 months, and found positive findings related to oral contraception continuation and knowledge. Future studies would be strengthened by objectively measuring outcomes and examining additional contraceptive methods and outcomes at least 12 months post-intervention.

This review updates a previous review of contraceptive education. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Multiple databases were searched for articles published March 2011-November 2016. Primary outcomes were knowledge, participation in and satisfaction/comfort with decision making, attitudes toward contraception, and selection of more effective methods. Secondary outcomes included contraceptive behaviors and pregnancy. Excluded articles described interventions that had no comparison group, could not be conducted feasibly in a clinic setting, or were conducted outside the U.S. or similar country. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 24,953 articles were identified. Combined with the original review, 37 articles met inclusion criteria and described 31 studies implementing a range of educational approaches (interactive tools, written materials, audio/videotapes, and text messages), with and without healthcare provider feedback, for a total of 36 independent interventions. Of the 31 interventions for which knowledge was assessed, 28 had a positive effect. Fewer were assessed for their effect on attitudes toward contraception, selection of more effective methods, contraceptive behaviors, or pregnancy-although increased knowledge was found to mediate additional outcomes (positive attitudes toward contraception and contraceptive continuation). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review is consistent with evidence from the broader healthcare field in suggesting that a range of interventions can increase knowledge. Future studies should assess what aspects are most effective, the benefits of including provider feedback, and the extent to which educational interventions can facilitate behavior change and attainment of reproductive health goals.

JOUR	[BLANK]	Client Preferences for Contraceptive Counseling: ASystematic Review	Fox ER, A.  Malcolm, N. M.  Rosmarin, R. B.  Zapata, L. B.  Frederiksen, B. N.  Moskosky, S. B.  Dehlendorf, C.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]	691-702	[EndPage]	Am J Prev Med		[BLANK]	[BLANK]	55	[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue			[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	CONTEXT: Providers can help clients achieve their personal reproductive goals by providing high-quality, client-centered contraceptive counseling. Given the individualized nature of contraceptive decision making, provider attention to clients' preferences for counseling interactions can enhance client centeredness. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on what preferences clients have for the contraceptive counseling they receive. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review is part of an update to a prior review series to inform contraceptive counseling in clinical settings. Sixteen electronic bibliographic databases were searched for studies related to client preferences for contraceptive counseling published in the U.S. or similar settings from March 2011 through November 2016. Because studies on client preferences were not included in the prior review series, a limited search was conducted for earlier research published from October 1992 through February 2011. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In total, 26 articles met inclusion criteria, including 17 from the search of literature published March 2011 or later and nine from the search of literature from October 1992 through February 2011. Nineteen articles included results about client preferences for information received during counseling, 13 articles included results about preferences for the decision-making process, 13 articles included results about preferences for the relationship between providers and clients, and 11 articles included results about preferences for the context in which contraceptive counseling is delivered. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the mostly small, qualitative studies included in this review describes preferences for the contraceptive counseling interaction. Provider attention to these preferences may improve the quality of family planning care; future research is needed to explore interventions designed to meet preferences.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Multiple databases, including PubMed, were searched during 2016-2017 for articles published from March 1, 2011, to November 30, 2016. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The search strategy identified 24,953 articles; ten studies met inclusion criteria. Two of three new studies that examined contraceptive counseling interventions (i.e., enhanced models to standard of care) among adolescents and young adults found a statistically significant positive impact on at least one outcome of interest. Five of seven new studies that examined contraceptive counseling, in general, or specific counseling interventions or aspects of counseling (e.g., personalization) among adults or mixed populations (adults and adolescents) found a statistically significant positive impact on at least one outcome of interest. In combination with the initial review, six of nine studies among adolescents and young adults and 16 of 23 studies among adults or mixed populations found a statistically significant positive impact of counseling on at least one outcome of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, evidence supports the utility of contraceptive counseling, in general, and specific interventions or aspects of counseling. Promising components of contraceptive counseling were identified. The following would strengthen the evidence base: improved documentation of counseling content and processes, increased attention to the relationships between client experiences and behavioral outcomes, and examining the comparative effectiveness of different counseling approaches to identify those that are most effective.

No previous report has compared the effects of carbetocin to those of misoprostol. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effects of carbetocin to those of misoprostol for management of the third stage of labor and for the prevention of PPH. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library (Central), Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Ovid, clinicaltrial.gov , and PubMed databases on December 28, 2017. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by 2 of the authors independently. Individual and pooled incidences were calculated for the included studies, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed model for forest plots without heterogeneity and a random effect model for those with heterogeneity. RESULTS: Our search identified 117 studies; however, 29 studies were duplicate. Of the 88 non-duplicate studies, 5 met the inclusion criteria. Of these five studies, two are currently underway. Hence, three studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of the impact of carbetocin on PPH (500-1000 ml) was (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14-0.50). Carbetocin significantly reduced the need for additional uterotonics (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49). Reduction in the hemoglobin level and blood loss during the third stage of labor was significantly lower in women who received carbetocin than in those who received misoprostol. The length of the third stage of labor was significantly lower in women who received carbetocin than in those who received misoprostol. The incidence of side effects, such as heat sensation, metallic taste, fever, and shivering, were significantly lower in women who received carbetocin than in those who received misoprostol. CONCLUSION: Although this review showed that carbetocin is effective for decreasing PPH, blood loss, the length of the third stage of labor, and the need for additional uterotonics, this conclusion should be considered with caution. Because assessment of PPH is a subjective issue and it is uncertain whether outcomes were assessed blindly in respect to treatment. We recommend future research to verify our findings. Also clinicians may like to consider use of carbetocin for women with low risk for PPH.	10.1186/s13643-018-0832-4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18627	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

New methods might enable developers to produce a knowledge base more rapidly. However, trading off scientific rigour for speed when creating a knowledge base is controversial, and the consequences are insufficiently known. We developed and applied faster methods including systematic reviews and network meta-analyses, assessed their feasibility and compared them to a gold standard approach. We also assessed the feasibility of using decision analysis to perform this comparison. METHODS: Long-term treatment in bipolar disorder was our testing field. We developed two new methods: an empirically based, rapid network meta-analysis (NMA) and an expert NMA, and conducted a patient survey. We applied these methods to collect effect estimates for evidence-based treatments on outcomes important to patients. The relative importance of outcomes was obtained from patients using a stated preference method. We used multi-criteria decision analysis to compare a gold standard NMA with the rapid NMA in terms of the ability of the gold standard NMA to change the ranking and expected values of treatments for individual patients. RESULTS: Using rapid methods, it was feasible to identify evidence addressing outcomes important to patients. We found that replacing effect estimates from our rapid NMA with estimates from the gold standard NMA resulted in relatively small changes in the ranking and expected value of treatments. The rapid method sufficed to estimate the effects of nine out of ten options. To produce a ranking of treatments accurate for more than 95% of patients, it was necessary to supplement systematic with rapid methods and to use relative importance weights in the analysis. Integrating estimates of the outcome "treatment burden" had a larger impact on rankings than replacing rapid with gold standard methods. Using patients' importance weights only modestly affected results. CONCLUSIONS: The transfer of knowledge to practice could benefit from faster systematic reviewing methods. The results in this preliminary assessment suggest that an improved rapid NMA approach might replace gold standard NMAs. Decision analysis could be used to compare evidence summarisation methods.	10.1186/s13643-018-0829-z	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18628	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Human suffering from paragonimiasis is often misunderstood and its quantification by the disability weight of the disability-adjusted life years largely varies in different global burden of disease (GBD) estimates. This paper is to systematically review clinical paragonimiasis cases and requantify the disability weight of human paragonimiasis. METHODS: A systematic analysis was conducted using articles from the following databases: PubMed, Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese scientific journal databases Wanfang Data and CQVIP, Africa Journal Online, and the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe. Search terms were the combination of "paragonim*" with "clinical" or "infection". Only articles fulfilling the following conditions were recruited for this study: the occurrence of clinical signs and symptoms of paragonimiasis in human beings were reported; diagnosis was confirmed; no comorbidities were reported; the reviewed clinical cases or epidemiological findings were not already included in any other articles. The information and frequencies of paragonimiasis outcomes from included articles using predefined data fields were extracted two times by two separate individuals. Outcome disability weights were selected mainly from the GBD 2004 and GBD 2013 datasets. Frequencies and disability weights of paragonimiasis outcomes were modelled into a decision tree using the additive approach and multiplicative approach, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations were run 5000 times for an uncertainty analysis. RESULTS: The disability weight estimates of paragonimiasis were simulated with 5302 clinical cases from 80 general articles. The overall disability weight was estimated at 0.1927 (median 0.1956) with a 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of 0.1632-0.2378 using the additive approach, and 0.1791 (median 0.1816) with a 95% UI of 0.1530-0.2182 using the multiplicative approach. The simulated disability weights of Paragonimus westermani cases were higher than that of P. skrjabini cases. Lung outcomes and headache were the top two contributors to disability weight for both species. CONCLUSIONS: The use of paragonimiasis disability weight needs to be reconsidered with regard to availability of morbidity data and species variation. Calculating the disease burden of paragonimiasis requires further modification and thus has considerable implications for public health prioritization in research, monitoring, and control.	10.1186/s40249-018-0485-5	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18629	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

As more patients undergo treatment with anticoagulating agents, critically bleeding episodes in patients with vitamin K antagonists, thrombin inhibitor, or factor Xa inhibitor-inducted coagulopathy will be encountered frequently by physicians. Hence, an effective treatment capable of reversing the iatrogenic coagulopathy in the acute setting is needed. In randomised clinical trials and observational studies, prothrombin complex concentrate has been reported to be superior to other acute interventions, and many guidelines recommend prothrombin complex concentrate in treatment of critically bleeding patients. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the evidence of the effects of prothrombin complex concentrate compared with placebo, no intervention, or other treatment options in critically bleeding patients treated with oral anticoagulants. METHODS/DESIGN: A comprehensive search for relevant published literature will be undertaken in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Science Citation Index, regulatory databases, and trial registers. We will include randomised clinical trials comparing prothrombin complex concentrate versus placebo, no intervention, or other interventions in critically bleeding patients with oral anticoagulant-induced coagulopathy. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be handled by two independent review authors. Meta-analysis will be performed as recommended by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, bias will be assessed with domains, and trial sequential analysis will be conducted to control random errors. Certainty will be assessed by GRADE. DISCUSSION: As critical bleeding in patients treated with oral anticoagulants is an increasing problem, an up-to-date systematic review evaluating the benefits and harms of prothrombin complex concentrate is urgently needed. It is the hope that this review will be able to guide best practice in treatment and clinical research of these critically bleeding patients.

Although recent evidence points to chronic immune activation to be a significant aspect in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM and CVDs, the exact role of T cells is not fully understood. Therefore, we aim to investigate T cell function and cardio vascular risk in T2DM. In addition, the therapeutic effect of blood glucose-lowering drugs to reverse hyperglycaemia induced T cell dysfunction and myocardial infarction will be reviewed. METHODS: This will be a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies assessing T cell activation and cardiovascular risk in adults with T2DM. The search strategy will include medical subject headings (MeSH) words for PubMed/MEDLINE database. The search terms will also be adapted to grey literature, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases. Studies will be independently screened by two reviewers using predefined criteria. Relevant eligible full texts will be screened and data will be extracted. Data extraction will be performed using a pre-piloted structured form. To assess the quality and strengths of evidence across selected studies, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation approach will be used. The Cochran's Q statistic and the I(2) statistics will be used to analyse statistical heterogeneity between studies. If included studies show substantial level of statistical heterogeneity, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed using R statistical software. DISCUSSIONS: This review will not require ethical approval, and the findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and conferences. Although other previous studies have reported deregulated T cell function in hyperglycaemia, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. However, evidence suggests that T cells may be a key component in the development of T2DM and CVDs as its complication. Furthermore, they are a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in the management of the disease.

But the relationship between tooth loss and dementia is not yet fully understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the relative effect of tooth loss on dementia risk. METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Knowledge was conducted in March 2018 to identify relevant observational studies with the English language restriction. Studies were included if they assessed the relationship between tooth loss and risk of dementia. Study quality was detected by the modified Downs and Black scale. Odds risks (ORs) were pooled using a random-effects model in the crude model. RESULTS: The literature search initially yielded 1574 articles, and 21 observational studies published between 1994 and 2017 were finally included for the analyses. The crude results with random-effects model showed that patients with multiple tooth loss had higher incidence of dementia (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.90-3.61, P < 0.001, I(2) = 90.40%). The association remained noted when only adjusted results were pooled from 18 studies (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.41-1.70, P = 0.13, I(2) = 28.00%). Meta-regression analysis showed that study design explained about 16.52% of heterogeneity in the crude model. The overall quality rating scores of studies ranged from 11 to 16. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review evidenced that tooth loss is positively associated with an increased risk of dementia in adults. Future well-designed longitudinal researches examining the direct and indirect relationship between tooth loss and dementia risk are encouraged.	10.1186/s12888-018-1927-0	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18632	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

COL9A3 gene encodes the alpha3 (IX) chain of type IX collagen that is part of the interior structure of the disc. Mutations in COL9A3 gene sequence, leading to an Arg103Trp substitution in its 3 chain (the Trp3 allele at rs61734651 site), respectively, have been found to be connected with IDD occurrence in several studies. However, those studies have showed conflict results. Thus, a meta-analysis has been performed to assess the associations between the COL9A3 trp3 polymorphism and IDD. METHODS: Data were gathered from the following four electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Embase and Cochrane library up to January 01, 2018. The pooled odds ratio (polled ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the strength of relationship between the COL9A3 trp3 polymorphism and IDD. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies with 1631 cases of IDD and 1366 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that the COL9A3 trp3 polymorphism was not associated with IDD (trp3 positive versus trp3 negative: OR = 1.31, 95%CI = 0.78-2.21, P = 0.309). Furthermore, the Egger's test and the Begg funnel plot did not show any evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the COL9A3 trp3 polymorphism might not be associated with IDD. Nor did we find any relationship in subgroup analyses stratified by gender and ethnicity. Future researches with larger samples are required to verify this outcome.	10.1186/s12891-018-2297-y	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	18633	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]		[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The aim is to investigate the effect of an intervention on adverse outcomes in frail older adults. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Social Sciences Citation Index. Randomized controlled studies that aimed to treat frail community-dwelling older adults, were included. The outcomes were mortality, hospitalization, formal health costs, accidental falls, and institutionalization. Several sub-analyses were performed (duration of intervention, average age, dimension, recruitment). RESULTS: Twenty-five articles (16 original studies) were included. Six types of interventions were found. The pooled odds ratios (OR) for mortality when allocated in the experimental group were 0.99 [95% CI: 0.79, 1.25] for case management and 0.78 [95% CI: 0.41, 1.45] for provision information intervention. For institutionalization, the pooled OR with case management was 0.92 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.32], and the pooled OR for information provision intervention was 1.53 [95% CI: 0.64, 3.65]. The pooled OR for hospitalization when allocated in the experimental group was 1.13 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.35] for case management. Further sub-analyses did not yield any significant findings. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis does not provide sufficient scientific evidence that interventions by frail older adults can be protective against the included adverse outcomes. A sub-analysis for some variables yielded no significant effects, although some findings suggested a decrease in adverse outcomes.
