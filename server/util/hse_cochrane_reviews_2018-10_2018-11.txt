This Cochrane Review is an updated review, first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2007 and 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirthâ€™s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (13 September 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results For this update, we included 63 trials (data from 58 trials, 5909 women), with moderate to high risk of bias overall. We carried out GRADE assessments for the main 'antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug' comparison only. Evidence was graded from very low to moderate certainty, with downgrading mainly due to design limitations and imprecision.For many outcomes, trials contributing data evaluated different hypertensive drugs; while we did not downgrade for this indirectness, results should be interpreted with caution. Antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug (31 trials, 3485 women) Primary outcomes: moderateâ€certainty evidence suggests that use of antihypertensive drug(s) probably halves the risk of developing severe hypertension (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; 20 trials, 2558 women), but may have little or no effect on the risk of proteinuria/preâ€eclampsia (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; 23 trials, 2851 women; lowâ€certainty evidence). Moderateâ€certainty evidence also shows that antihypertensive drug(s) probably have little or no effect in the risk of total reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) (aRR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.04; 29 trials, 3365 women), smallâ€forâ€gestationalâ€age babies (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18; 21 trials, 2686 babies) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.12; 15 trials, 2141 women). Secondary outcomes: we are uncertain of the effect of antihypertensive drug(s) on the risk of maternal death , severe preâ€eclampsia , or eclampsia, or impaired longâ€term growth and development of the baby in infancy and childhood , because the certainty of this evidence is very low. There may be little or no effect on the risk of changed/stopped drugs due to maternal sideâ€effects, or admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery (lowâ€certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of elective delivery (moderateâ€certainty evidence). Antihypertensive drug versus another antihypertensive drug (29 trials, 2774 women) Primary outcomes: beta blockers and calcium channel blockers together in the metaâ€analysis appear to be more effective than methyldopa in avoiding an episode of severe hypertension (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88; 11 trials, 638 women). There was also an increase in this risk when other antihypertensive drugs were compared with calcium channel blockers (RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.15; 5 trials, 223 women), but no evidence of a difference when methyldopa and calcium channel blockers together were compared with beta blockers (RR1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.48; 10 trials, 692 women). No evidence of a difference in the risk of proteinuria/preâ eclampsia was found when alternative drugs were compared with methyldopa (aRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06; 11 trials, 997 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR: 1.24, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.19; 5 trials, 375 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.67; 12 trials, 1107 women). For the babies, we found no evidence of a difference in the risk of total reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) when comparing other antihypertensive drugs with methyldopa (aRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.14; 22 trials, 1791 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57; nine trials, 700 babies), or with beta blockers (aRR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.88; 19 trials, 1652 babies); nor in the risk for smallâ€forâ€gestational age in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20; seven trials, 597 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.73; four trials, 200 babies), or with beta blockers (average RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.60; 7 trials, 680 babies). No evidence of an overall difference among groups in the risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) was found in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.22; 11 trials, 835 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.23; six trials, 330 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.66; 9 trials, 806 women). Secondary outcomes: There were no cases of maternal death and eclampsia. There is no evidence of a difference in the risk of severe preâ€eclampsia , changed/stopped drug due to maternal sideâ€effects , elective delivery, admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery when other antihypertensive drugs are compared with methyldopa, calcium channel blockers or beta blockers. Impaired longâ€term growth and development in infancy and childhood was not reported for these comparisons. Authors' conclusions Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy reduces the risk of severe hypertension. The effect on other clinically important outcomes remains unclear. If antihypertensive drugs are used, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers appear to be more effective than the alternatives for preventing severe hypertension. Highâ€quality large sampleâ€sized randomised controlled trials are required in order to provide reliable estimates of the benefits and adverse effects of antihypertensive treatment for mild to moderate hypertension for both mother and baby, as well as costs to the health services, women and their families. Plain language summary Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy What is the issue? The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and adverse effects of blood pressureâ€lowering drugs (antihypertensive drugs) for pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure). The other aim was to assess the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs for their babies. Why is this important? During pregnancy, up to one in 10 women have blood pressure readings that are above normal. For some women, their blood pressure remains slightly high (termed â€˜mild to moderate high blood pressureâ€™), with no apparent complications. Some of these women go on to develop very high blood pressure. Very high blood pressure can result in a medical emergency if it affects the womanâ€™s organs (such as her liver, or brain in the form of a stroke). Also, it can seriously affect the growth and health of her baby. Drugs that lower blood pressure are used to treat mild to moderate high blood pressure, in the belief that this treatment will prevent the blood pressure from continuing to rise. Over the years, information from good quality research studies has been contradictory, so we cannot be sure if this drug treatment is worthwhile. What evidence did we find? This Cochrane Review is an update of a review that was first published in 2001 and updated in 2007 and 2014. We searched for randomised controlled trials in September 2017, and this review now includes data f om 58 trials involving more than 5900 women. A total of 31 trials with 3485 women compared a number of different blood pressureâ€lowering drugs to a placebo or no treatment. There were a further 29 trials involving 2774 women which compared one blood pressureâ€lowering drug with another one. The evidence showed that treating pregnant women who had moderately raised blood pressure with blood pressureâ€lowering drugs probably halved the number of the women developing severe high blood pressure (20 trials, 2558 women). However, blood pressureâ€lowering drugs probably had little or no effect on the risk of the baby dying (29 trials, 3365 women), and there is insufficient data on maternal deaths to make a judgement on whether this risk is lowered (five trials, 525 women). The use of blood pressureâ€lowering drugs may have little or no effect on the number of the women developing preâ€eclampsia (23 trials, 2851 women), or the number of women who had to change drugs because of sideâ€effects (16 trials, 1503 women). We found no difference in the number of babies born preterm, that is before 37 weeks (15 trials, 2141 women). There was also no difference in the number of babies born small for their gestational age (21 trials, 2686 babies). The quality of the evidence was mostly moderate (but for preâ€eclampsia it was low). This was due to a number of small studies, and problems with the way the studies were undertaken. The available evidence is still insufficient to demonstrate if there is any antihypertensive drug that is better than another. However, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers seem to be better than the alternative drugs for blood pressure control. What does this mean? More research is needed in order to confirm the true effect of antihypertensive drugs in mothers and in their babies, and to identify the drug which would be best.	10.1002/14651858.CD002252.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	482	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002252.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Carcinoma of the rectum is a common malignancy, especially in high income countries. Local recurrence may occur after surgery alone. Preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) has the potential to reduce the risk of local recurrence and improve outcomes in rectal cancer. Objectives To determine the effect of preoperative radiotherapy for people with localised resectable rectal cancer compared to surgery alone. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library; Issue 5, 2018) (4 June 2018), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to 4 June 2018), and Embase (Ovid) (1974 to 4 June 2018). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for relevant ongoing trials (4 June 2018). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing PRT and surgery with surgery alone for people with localised advanced rectal cancer planned for radical surgery. We excluded trials that did not use contemporary radiotherapy techniques (with more than two fields to the pelvis). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the 'Risk of bias' domains for each included trial, and extracted data. For time‐to‐event data, we calculated the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) and variances, and for dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) using the random‐effects method. Potential sources of heterogeneity hypothesised a priori included study quality, staging, and the use of total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery. Main results We included four trials with a total of 4663 participants. All four trials reported short PRT courses, with three trials using 25 Gy in five fractions, and one trial using 20 Gy in four fractions. Only one study specifically required TME surgery for inclusion, whereas in another study 90% of participants received TME surgery. Preoperative radiotherapy probably reduces overall mortality at 4 to 12 years' follow‐up (4 trials, 4663 participants; Peto OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.98; moderate‐quality evidence). For every 1000 people who undergo surgery alone, 454 would die compared with 45 fewer (the true effect may lie between 77 fewer to 9 fewer) in the PRT group. There was some evidence from subgroup analyses that in trials using TME no or little effect of PRT on survival (P = 0.03 for the difference between subgroups). Preoperative radiotherapy may have little or no effect in reducing cause‐specific mortality for rectal cancer (2 trials, 2145 participants; Peto OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03; low‐quality evidence). We found moderate‐quality evidence that PRT reduces local recurrence (4 trials, 4663 participants; Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.57). In absolute terms, 161 out of 1000 patients receiving surgery alone would experience local recurrence compared with 83 fewer with PRT. The results were consistent in TME and non‐TME studies. There may be little or no difference in curative resection (4 trials, 4673 participants; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; low‐quality evidence) or in the need for sphincter‐sparing surgery (3 trials, 4379 participants; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04; I 2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) between PRT and surgery alone. Low‐quality evidence suggests that PRT may increase the risk of sepsis from 13% to 16% (2 trials, 2698 participants; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.52) and surgical complications from 25% to 30% (2 trials, 2698 participants; RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42) compared to surgery alone. Two trials evaluated quality of life using different scales. Both studies concluded that sexual dysfunction occurred more in the PRT group. Mixed results were found for faecal incontinence, and irradiated participants tended to resume work later than non‐irradiated participants between 6 and 12 months, but this effect had attenuated after 18 months (low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that PRT reduces overall mortality. Subgroup analysis did not onfirm this effect in people undergoing TME surgery. We found consistent evidence that PRT reduces local recurrence. Risk of sepsis and postsurgical complications may be higher with PRT. The main limitation of the findings of the present review concerns their applicability. The included trials only assessed short‐course radiotherapy and did not use chemotherapy, which is widely used in the contemporary management of rectal cancer disease. The differences between the trials regarding the criteria used to define rectal cancer, staging, radiotherapy delivered, the time between radiotherapy and surgery, and the use of adjuvant or postoperative therapy did not appear to influence the size of effect across the studies. Future trials should focus on identifying participants that are most likely to benefit from PRT especially in terms of improving local control, sphincter preservation, and overall survival while reducing acute and late toxicities (especially rectal and sexual function), as well as determining the effect of radiotherapy when chemotherapy is used and the optimal timing of surgery following radiotherapy. Plain language summary Preoperative radiotherapy and curative surgery for the management of localised rectal carcinoma Background Rectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths in the western world. Individuals diagnosed with rectal cancer are mainly treated with surgery. However, the risk remains that rectal cancer will recur after surgical treatment. A course of radiotherapy before surgery might reduce the risk of local recurrence because radiotherapy can destroy smaller residual tumours and enhance the effects of surgery. Study characteristics We searched medical databases on 4 June 2018 for randomised trials (experimental studies where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) to determine whether there is any benefit to radiotherapy before surgical treatment for people with rectal cancer in terms of reducing the risk of dying from any cause, the risk of dying from cancer, and the risk of cancer recurring in the pelvis. We considered high‐dose regimen of radiotherapy followed by any type of surgical treatment to remove cancer of the rectum. Results We found four trials involving 4663 people with operable rectal cancer. Our results suggest that administering short‐course radiotherapy before surgery probably reduces mortality. However, when our analysis was limited to a contemporary type of surgery (total mesorectal excision), there was no evidence of a difference between the group receiving radiotherapy before surgery and the group receiving surgery alone. There may be little or no difference between groups in cancer‐related death when short‐course radiotherapy is used. We found moderate quality evidence that using preoperative radiotherapy compared to surgery alone may provide substantial benefit in terms of reduction of local recurrence of the cancer. There was little or no effect of preoperative radiotherapy on curative resection and sphincter‐sparing surgery. We found higher rates of sepsis, surgical complications, and sexual complications in participants treated with radiotherapy compared to those who received only surgery. Quality of the evidence Overall the studies were well‐designed. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate for cancer recurrence and overall mortality, as there were serious concerns regarding the applicability of the findings to the contemporary management of rectal cancer. We further downgraded the quality of the evidence for the remaining outcomes due to imprecise results and/or variations between the trials regarding the criteria used to define rectal cancer, the stage of participants, preoperative imaging used for assessing stage, the type of surgery performed, the radiation dose and fractioning, the time between radiotherapy and surgery, and the use of adjuvant or postoperative therapy.	10.1002/14651858.CD002102.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	483	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002102.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

V.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	Aged  Antimanic Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]  Dementia [*complications]  Humans  Psychomotor Agitation [*drug therapy, etiology]  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic  Treatment Outcome  Valproic Acid [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Agitation has been reported in up to 90% of people with dementia. Agitation in people with dementia worsens carer burden, increases the risk of injury, and adds to the need for institutionalisation. Valproate preparations have been used in an attempt to control agitation in dementia, but their safety and efficacy have been questioned. Objectives To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of valproate preparations used to treat agitation in people with dementia, including the impact on carers. Search methods We searched ALOIS – the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 7 December 2017 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria Randomised, placebo‐controlled trials that assessed valproate preparations for agitation in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data in meta‐analyses where possible. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2009. We found no new studies for inclusion. Main results The review included five studies with 430 participants. Studies varied in the preparations of valproate, mean doses (480 mg/day to 1000 mg/day), duration of treatment (three weeks to six weeks), and outcome measures used. The studies were generally well conducted although some methodological information was missing and one study was at high risk of attrition bias. The quality of evidence related to our primary efficacy outcome of agitation varied from moderate to very low. We found moderate‐quality evidence from two studies that measured behaviour with the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (range 0 to 108) and with the BPRS agitation factor (range 0 to 18). They found that there was probably little or no effect of valproate treatment over six weeks (total BPRS: mean difference (MD) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) –2.14 to 2.59; 202 participants, 2 studies; BPRS agitation factor: MD –0.67, 95% CI –1.49 to 0.15; 202 participants, 2 studies). Very low‐quality evidence from three studies which measured agitation with the Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI) were consistent with a lack of effect of valproate treatment on agitation. There was variable quality evidence on other behaviour outcomes reported in single studies of no difference between groups or a benefit for the placebo group. Three studies, which measured cognitive function using the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), found little or no effect of valproate over six weeks, but we were uncertain about this result because the quality of the evidence was very low. Two studies that assessed functional ability using the Physical Self‐Maintenance Scale (PSMS) (range 6 to 30) found that there was probably slightly worse function in the valproate‐treated group, which was of uncertain clinical importance (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.98; 203 participants, 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Analysis of adverse effects and serious adverse events (SAE) indicated a higher incidence in valproate‐treated participants. A meta‐analysis of three studies showed that there may have been a higher rate of adverse effects among valproate‐treated participants than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.14; 381 participants, 3 studies, low‐quality evidence). Pooled analysis of the number of SAE for the two studies that reported such data indicated that participants treated with valproate preparations were more likely to experience SAEs (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 22.74; 228 participants, 2 studies), but th very low quality of the data made it difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding SAEs. Individual adverse events that were more frequent in the valproate‐treated group included sedation, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), and urinary tract infections. Authors' conclusions This updated review corroborates earlier findings that valproate preparations are probably ineffective in treating agitation in people with dementia, but are associated with a higher rate of adverse effects, and possibly of SAEs. On the basis of this evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia. Further research may not be justified, particularly in light of the increased risk of adverse effects in this often frail group of people. Research would be better focused on effective non‐pharmacological interventions for this patient group, or, for those situations where medication may be needed, further investigation of how to use other medications as effectively and safely as possible. Plain language summary Valproate preparations for the treatment of agitated behaviour in people with dementia Background Agitated behaviour is very common in the later stages of dementia. It can include verbal behaviours, such as shouting, and physical behaviours, such as wandering or physical aggression. It has been shown to worsen the stress experienced by family carers, increase the risk of injury, and increase the need for people with dementia to move into institutional care. A type of medication that has been used to treat agitated behaviour in people who have dementia is valproate, which is available in several different preparations (valproic acid, divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, and valproate semi‐sodium). These medications are not recommended in current guidelines (e.g. from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), but are sometimes still given to people with dementia to treat agitated behaviour. Purpose of this review We wanted to review the evidence about how effective and safe it is to give valproate preparations to people with dementia to treat agitation. Studies included in this review We searched medical databases up to December 2017 for studies that compared any preparation of valproate with a placebo (dummy tablet) to treat agitated behaviour in people diagnosed with dementia. We included five studies with 479 participants who had various types of dementia and agitated behaviour. Most studies lasted for six weeks, although one was only three weeks long. The studies were generally well conducted, but the methods were not always fully reported and one study was at high risk of bias because of the high number of people who dropped out from the valproate‐treated group. Key findings Studies measured agitated behaviour with various scales and the reliability of the evidence for the different scales ranged from moderate to very low. Overall, we found no evidence that valproate preparations improved behaviour, or specifically, agitated behaviour. We found that valproate preparations probably had little or no effect on participants' ability to perform daily activities. We could not be sure whether they had an effect on cognition (thinking and remembering) because the reliability of the evidence was very low. We found low‐reliability evidence from three studies that participants taking valproate may be more likely than those taking placebo to experience harmful effects. We could not be as certain about differences in serious harms, such as serious illness or admission to hospital, but data from two studies suggested that these may be more common in the participants taking valproate. Some of the side effects associated with valproate were sleepiness, feeling sick, being sick, watery stools, and urinary tract infections. Conclusions We only identified five relatively small studies for inclusion in this review. They varied in their methods, type of medicine and its dose, duration of treatment, and scales used to make measurements. This limited our ability to pool data across studies. However, we could be moderately confident in the conclusion that valproate preparations do not improve agitated behaviour in dementia. They may also be associated with harmful effects.	10.1002/14651858.CD003945.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	480	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003945.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

E.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	Aged  Amputation [methods, *rehabilitation]  Artificial Limbs [*psychology]  Femur [*surgery]  Humans  Leg [blood supply, surgery]  Middle Aged  Patient Satisfaction  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Dysvascularity accounts for 75% of all lower limb amputations in the UK. Around 37% of these procedures are done at the transfemoral level (mid‐thigh), with most patients over the age of 60 and having existing comorbidities. A significant number of these amputees are prescribed a lower limb prosthesis for walking. However, many amputees do not achieve a high level of function following prosthetic rehabilitation. This is the third update of the review first published in 2005. Objectives To identify and summarise the evidence evaluating prosthetic rehabilitation interventions for prosthetic ambulation following unilateral transfemoral or transgenicular amputation in older dysvascular people, whether community dwelling or institutionalised. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registry to 14 June 2018. We performed additional searches by handsearching citations of studies identified by the electronic search. We applied no restrictions on language or publication status. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials testing prosthetic rehabilitation interventions following a unilateral transfemoral or transgenicular amputation in older (aged 60 years or older) dysvascular people. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently scanned the search results for potentially eligible studies and, on obtaining full reports of these, selected studies for inclusion and exclusion. Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review. Main results We identified no new studies for inclusion in this update. In total we included one trial, excluded 18 trials, classed one trial as ongoing, and classed another as awaiting classification. The total number of participants in the included trial was 10, and the methodological quality of this trial was moderate because of high risk of bias in relation to two domains (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) but low risk of bias for the four remaining domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and any other bias). The included trial was a short‐term cross‐over randomised trial undertaken in Canada, which tested the effects of adding three seemingly identical prosthetic weights (150 g vs 770 g vs 1625 g) to the prostheses of a total of 10 participants with unilateral dysvascular transfemoral amputation. Eight participants were over 60 years of age. Trial authors found that four participants preferred the addition of the lightest weight (150 g), five preferred the middle weight (770 g), and one preferred the heaviest weight (1625 g). Researchers interpreted this as equating to user satisfaction (success) and reported no adverse effects. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence presented in this review is of very low quality and is insufficient to inform the choice of prosthetic rehabilitation, including the optimum weight of the prosthesis, after unilateral transfemoral amputation in older dysvascular people. A programme of research that includes randomised controlled trials to examine key interventions is urgently required in this area. Plain language summary Artificial limb rehabilitation for older people with a leg amputated at or above the knee because of blood circulation problems Background Problems with inadequate circulation in the legs (dysvascularity), particularly in people over the age of 60 years, can be so severe that they need a leg amputated. This may occur as high as at or above the knee. Accompanying medical conditions (comorbidities) such as diabetes and cardiovascular or heart disease can affect a person's rehabilitation. When an above‐ or through‐knee artificial limb (prosthesis) is fitted, it is hard for the person to regain mobility and function, and some people choose to use a wheelchair. Motivation, comfort, cosmetic appearance, functionality, reliability, ease of use, previous mobility, and the extra exertion needed to use an artificial leg are all important factors that can affect a person's independence and use of the prosthesis. Fear of falling, number of falls, social circumstances, and help and support from other people are also important influences. The review authors searched for trials comparing different types of rehabilitation that may benefit mobility or function in older people using an artificial limb. Study characteristics and key results Reviewers found only one controlled trial of moderate methodological quality (most recent search, 14 June 2018). This trial had a cross‐over design, and each of the 10 participants had three seemingly identical prosthetic weights added to the prosthesis below the knee in random order. All artificial limbs were modular‐style prostheses. The participants ‐ nine men and one woman ‐ were over 50 years of age, and eight were over 60 years old. Over the few hours of the trial, four participants preferred the lightest weight (150 g), five preferred the medium weight (770 g), and one preferred the heaviest weight (1625 g). Seven of the 10 people successfully ranked the weights from lightest to heaviest. The weights did not alter participants' walking speed in a two‐minute walk test. Study authors reported no adverse effects. Quality of the evidence and conclusions The inclusion of only one trial with a small number of participants, short exposure to different weights in a laboratory setting, and the fact that there were differences in weight between people and their prostheses limit the usefulness of these findings. The limited evidence included in this review is of very low quality and is insufficient to inform the choice of prosthetic rehabilitation, including optimum weight of the prosthesis, after unilateral transfemoral amputation in older dysvascular people.	10.1002/14651858.CD005260.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	506	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005260.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Treatments provided to improve dysphagia are aimed at accelerating recovery of swallowing function and reducing these risks. This is an update of the review first published in 1999 and updated in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects of swallowing therapy on death or dependency among stroke survivors with dysphagia within six months of stroke onset. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (26 June 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 June 2018), MEDLINE (26 June 2018), Embase (26 June 2018), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (26 June 2018), Web of Science Core Collection (26 June 2018), SpeechBITE (28 June 2016), ClinicalTrials.Gov (26 June 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (26 June 2018). We also searched Google Scholar (7 June 2018) and the reference lists of relevant trials and review articles. Selection criteria We sought to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for people with dysphagia and recent stroke (within six months). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence, and resolved disagreements through discussion with the third review author (PB). We used random‐effects models to calculate odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs), and standardised mean differences (SMDs), and provided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each. The primary outcome was functional outcome, defined as death or dependency (or death or disability), at the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes were case fatality at the end of the trial, length of inpatient stay, proportion of participants with dysphagia at the end of the trial, swallowing ability, penetration aspiration score, or pneumonia, pharyngeal transit time, institutionalisation, and nutrition. Main results We added 27 new studies (1777 participants) to this update to include a total of 41 trials (2660 participants). We assessed the efficacy of swallowing therapy overall and in subgroups by type of intervention: acupuncture (11 studies), behavioural interventions (nine studies), drug therapy (three studies), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES; six studies), pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES; four studies), physical stimulation (three studies), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; two studies), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; nine studies). Swallowing therapy had no effect on the primary outcome (death or dependency/disability at the end of the trial) based on data from one trial (two data sets) (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.75; 306 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; P = 0.86; moderate‐quality evidence). Swallowing therapy had no effect on case fatality at the end of the trial (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; 766 participants; 14 studies; I² = 6%; P = 0.99; moderate‐quality evidence). Swallowing therapy probably reduced length of inpatient stay (MD ‐2.9, 95% CI ‐5.65 to ‐0.15; 577 participants; 8 studies; I² = 11%; P = 0.04; moderate‐quality evidence). Researchers found no evidence of a subgroup effect based on testing for subgroup differences (P = 0.54). Swallowing therapy may have reduced the proportion of participants with dysphagia at the end of the trial (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.55; 1487 participants; 23 studies; I² = 0%; P = 0.00001; low‐quality evidence). Trial results show no evidence of a subgroup effect based on testing for subgroup differences (P = 0.91). Swallowing therapy may improve swallowing ability (SMD ‐0.66, 95% CI ‐1.01 to ‐0.32; 1173 participants; 26 studies; I² = 86%; P = 0.0002; very low‐quality evidence). We found no evidence of a subgroup effect based on testing for subgroup differences (P = 0.09). We noted moderate to substantial heterogeneity between trials for these interventions. Swallowing therapy did not reduce the penetration aspiration score (i.e. it did not reduce radiological aspiration) (SMD ‐0.37, 95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.00; 303 participants; 11 studies; I² = 46%; P = 0.05; low‐quality evidence). Swallowing therapy may reduce the incidence of chest infection or pneumonia (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78; 618 participants; 9 studies; I² = 59%; P = 0.009; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Moderate‐ and low‐quality evidence suggests that swallowing therapy did not have a significant effect on the outcomes of death or dependency/disability, case fatality at the end of the trial, or penetration aspiration score. However, swallowing therapy may have reduced length of hospital stay, dysphagia, and chest infections, and may have improved swallowing ability. However, these results are based on evidence of variable quality, involving a variety of interventions. Further high‐quality trials are needed to test whether specific interventions are effective. Plain language summary Swallowing therapy for difficulties with swallowing in stroke survivors who have had a recent stroke Question We wanted to assess the effectiveness of swallowing therapy for stroke survivors with dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). We looked at swallowing therapy in survivors up to six months after stroke. Background Stroke often results in difficulty swallowing. This can lead to choking, chest infections, poorer quality of life, longer hospital stay, and increased risk of death or discharge to a care home. Therapy to improve swallowing aims to speed up recovery of swallowing function and reduce these risks. Study characteristics This is an update of the review originally published in 1999 and previously updated in 2012. We have now included a total of 41 studies (2660 participants) , and the evidence is current to June 2018. Swallowing therapy comprises several different treatment types, and we looked at eight of these: acupuncture (11 studies), behavioural interventions (nine studies), drug therapy (three studies), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES; six studies), pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES; four studies), physical stimulation (three studies), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; two studies), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; nine studies). Key results Swallowing therapy did not result in less death or disability among stroke survivors, nor did it lead to a safer swallow after treatment. However, some individual swallowing therapies seemed to reduce hospital length of stay, lessen the chance of getting a chest infection or pneumonia, or improve swallowing ability and recovery from swallowing problems. Many of the swallowing therapies involved different methods of delivery, so it is still not clear which approach is most effective for each type of therapy. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was generally very low, low, or moderate. Additional high‐quality studies are needed.	10.1002/14651858.CD000323.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	504	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000323.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Pain and distress from needle‐related procedures are common during childhood and can be reduced through use of psychological interventions (cognitive or behavioral strategies, or both). Our first review update (Issue 10, 2013) showed efficacy of distraction and hypnosis for needle‐related pain and distress in children and adolescents. Objectives To assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for needle‐related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched six electronic databases for relevant trials: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Embase; Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge); and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We sent requests for additional studies to pediatric pain and child health electronic listservs. We also searched registries for relevant completed trials: clinicaltrials.gov ; and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int.trialsearch) . We conducted searches up to September 2017 to identify records published since the last review update in 2013. Selection criteria We included peer‐reviewed published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least five participants per study arm, comparing a psychological intervention with a control or comparison group. Trials involved children aged two to 19 years undergoing any needle‐related medical procedure. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed risks of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We examined pain and distress assessed by child self‐report, observer global report, and behavioral measurement (primary outcomes). We also examined any reported physiological outcomes and adverse events (secondary outcomes). We used meta‐analysis to assess the efficacy of identified psychological interventions relative to a comparator (i.e. no treatment, other active treatment, treatment as usual, or waitlist) for each outcome separately. We used Review Manager 5 software to compute standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 59 trials (20 new for this update) with 5550 participants. Needle procedures primarily included venipuncture, intravenous insertion, and vaccine injections. Studies included children aged two to 19 years, with few trials focused on adolescents. The most common psychological interventions were distraction (n = 32), combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n = 18), and hypnosis (n = 8). Preparation/information (n = 4), breathing (n = 4), suggestion (n = 3), and memory alteration (n = 1) were also included. Control groups were often 'standard care', which varied across studies. Across all studies, 'Risk of bias' scores indicated several domains at high or unclear risk, most notably allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessment, and selective reporting. We downgraded the quality of evidence largely due to serious study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. Very low‐ to low‐quality evidence supported the efficacy of distraction for self‐reported pain (n = 30, 2802 participants; SMD −0.56, 95% CI −0.78 to −0.33) and distress (n = 4, 426 participants; SMD −0.82, 95% CI −1.45 to −0.18), observer‐reported pain (n = 11, 1512 participants; SMD −0.62, 95% CI −1.00 to −0.23) and distress (n = 5, 1067 participants; SMD −0.72, 95% CI −1.41 to −0.03), and behavioral distress (n = 7, 500 participants; SMD −0.44, 95% CI −0.84 to −0.04). Distraction was not efficacious for behavioral pain (n = 4, 309 participants; SMD −0.33, 95% CI −0.69 to 0.03). Very low‐quality evidence indicated hypnosis was efficacious for reducing self‐reported pain (n = 5, 176 participants; SMD −1.40, 95% CI −2.32 to −0.48) and distress (n = 5, 176 participants; SMD −2.53, 95% CI −3.93 to −1.12 , and behavioral distress (n = 6, 193 participants; SMD −1.15, 95% CI −1.76 to −0.53), but not behavioral pain (n = 2, 69 participants; SMD −0.38, 95% CI −1.57 to 0.81). No studies assessed hypnosis for observer‐reported pain and only one study assessed observer‐reported distress. Very low‐ to low‐quality evidence supported the efficacy of combined CBT for observer‐reported pain (n = 4, 385 participants; SMD −0.52, 95% CI −0.73 to −0.30) and behavioral distress (n = 11, 1105 participants; SMD −0.40, 95% CI −0.67 to −0.14), but not self‐reported pain (n = 14, 1359 participants; SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.58 to 0.03), self‐reported distress (n = 6, 234 participants; SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.56 to 0.04), observer‐reported distress (n = 6, 765 participants; SMD 0.08, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.50), or behavioral pain (n = 2, 95 participants; SMD −0.65, 95% CI −2.36 to 1.06). Very low‐quality evidence showed efficacy of breathing interventions for self‐reported pain (n = 4, 298 participants; SMD −1.04, 95% CI −1.86 to −0.22), but there were too few studies for meta‐analysis of other outcomes. Very low‐quality evidence revealed no effect for preparation/information (n = 4, 313 participants) or suggestion (n = 3, 218 participants) for any pain or distress outcome. Given only a single trial, we could draw no conclusions about memory alteration. Adverse events of respiratory difficulties were only reported in one breathing intervention. Authors' conclusions We identified evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction, hypnosis, combined CBT, and breathing interventions for reducing children’s needle‐related pain or distress, or both. Support for the efficacy of combined CBT and breathing interventions is new from our last review update due to the availability of new evidence. The quality of trials and overall evidence remains low to very low, underscoring the need for improved methodological rigor and trial reporting. Despite low‐quality evidence, the potential benefits of reduced pain or distress or both support the evidence in favor of using these interventions in clinical practice. Plain language summary Psychological strategies to reduce pain and distress for children and adolescents getting needles Bottom line Psychological strategies help reduce children's pain, distress, and fear of needles. Distraction and hypnosis are helpful, although specific breathing (such as inflating a balloon), and combining multiple psychological strategies can also help. Background Psychological strategies affect how children think or what they do before, during, or after a needle. They can be used by children or with support from parents or medical staff, like nurses, psychologists, or child life specialists. The information applies to children aged from two to 19 years who are healthy or ill, undergoing all types of needle procedures at the hospital, in a clinic, or at school. Key results For this update, in September 2017, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological strategies for reducing pain and distress of children and teens getting a needle. We found 59 trials including 5550 children and teens. Twenty of these trials were new for this update. We found six psychological strategies, four of which help reduce children's pain and distress during needles. These include distraction, hypnosis, specific breathing, and combining multiple strategies (‘combined cognitive behavioral’). Ways to distract children and teens during needles include reading, watching a movie, listening to music, playing video games, or virtual reality. Hypnosis involves deep relaxation and imagery, and is usually taught to a child by a trained professional. Examples of strategies that can be combined include distraction, breathing, relaxation, positive thoughts, having the child learn or practice the steps of the needle procedure, and coaching parents about ways to support their child. Other psychological strategies have been tested but do not seem helpful on their own. For example, children do not hav less pain or distress when they are only told what is going to happen before or during the needle ('providing information or preparation or both) or when someone merely suggests to the child that something is being done to help them. One other strategy is helping children to remember their previous needles more positively. There is not enough information yet to know if this is helpful. Quality of evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. The quality of the evidence from this review is very low to low, as results may be biased by including only small numbers of children or by children knowing what psychological intervention they received. This means that we are uncertain about the results.	10.1002/14651858.CD005179.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	481	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005179.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Objectives To assess whether action observation enhances motor function and upper limb motor performance and cortical activation in people with stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 4 September 2017), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (24 October 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 24 October 2017), Embase (1974 to 24 October 2017) and five additional databases. We also searched trial registries and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AO, alone or associated with physical practice in adults after stroke. The primary outcome was upper limb motor function. Secondary outcomes included dependence on activities of daily living (ADL), motor performance, cortical activation, quality of life, and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials according to the pre‐defined inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. The reviews authors contacted trial authors for clarification and missing information. Main results We included 12 trials involving 478 individuals. A number of trials showed a high risk of bias and others an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting. The quality of the evidence was 'low' for most of the outcomes and 'moderate' for hand function, according to the GRADE system. In most of the studies, AO was followed by some form of physical activity. Primary outcome: the impact of AO on arm function showed a small significant effect (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60; 8 studies; 314 participants; low‐quality evidence); and a large significant effect (mean difference (MD) 2.90, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.66; 3 studies; 132 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) on hand function. Secondary outcomes: there was a large significant effect for ADL outcome (SMD 0.86, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61; 4 studies, 226 participants; low‐quality evidence). We were unable to pool other secondary outcomes to extract the evidence. Only two studies reported adverse effects without significant adverse AO events. Authors' conclusions We found evidence that AO is beneficial in improving upper limb motor function and dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) in people with stroke, when compared with any control group; however, we considered the quality of the evidence to be low. We considered the effect of AO on hand function to be large, but it does not appear to be clinically relevant, although we considered the quality of the evidence as moderate. As such, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited because it will likely change with future research. Plain language summary Action observation for arm rehabilitation after stroke Review question   We sought to compare the effects of action observation on arm and hand function after stroke with an alternative intervention or no intervention. Background   Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Individuals who survive a stroke have difficulty moving their arms, which can lead to problems with everyday activities and reduced participation in daily situations. Action observation (AO) is a physical rehabilitation approach proposed for arm rehabilitation, in which stroke survivor observes a healthy individual performing a task, either on video or in person, followed or not by execution of the same task. This safe technique can be performed without expensive and complicated equipment and requires minimal therapist supervision. Studies show that AO activates brain areas similar to those activated when performing the same action, and may favor movement recovery after stroke. Study characteristics   We identified 12 studies involving 478 individuals after stroke. Most used video sequences and AO followed by some form of physical activity, using a range of activities, with task complexity increased over the course of training or when it was easy for the participant to carry out. The evidence is current to October 2017. Key results   Studies tested whether the use of AO compared with an alternative intervention or no intervention resulted in participants' improved ability to use their arms and hands, and found that AO therapy resulted in better arm (eight trials) and hand function (three trials). Quality of the evidence   We classified the quality of the evidence as moderate for hand function, low for arm function and dependence on activities of daily living, and very low for motor performance and quality of life. Participants could engage in AO safely, since adverse events were not significant in scale or magnitude. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to the small number of study participants, low study quality, and poor reporting of study details.	10.1002/14651858.CD011887.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	521	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011887.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Interventions for preventing and treating cardiac complications in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and X‐linked dilated cardiomyopathy	Bourke JPB, T.  Quinlivan, R.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background The dystrophinopathies include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and X‐linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM). In recent years, co‐ordinated multidisciplinary management for these diseases has improved the quality of care, with early corticosteroid use prolonging independent ambulation, and the routine use of non‐invasive ventilation signficantly increasing survival. The next target to improve outcomes is optimising treatments to delay the onset or slow the progression of cardiac involvement and so prolong survival further. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for preventing or treating cardiac involvement in DMD, BMD, and XLDCM, using measures of change in cardiac function over six months. Search methods On 16 October 2017 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, and on 12 December 2017, we searched two clinical trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and bibliographies. Selection criteria We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and randomised cross‐over trials for inclusion. In the Discussion, we reviewed open studies, longitudinal observational studies and individual case reports but only discussed studies that adequately described the diagnosis, intervention, pretreatment, and post‐treatment states and in which follow‐up lasted for at least six months. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified from the search and performed data extraction. All three authors assessed risk of bias independently, compared results, and decided which trials met the inclusion criteria. They assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE criteria. Main results We included five studies (N = 205) in the review; four studies included participants with DMD only, and one study included participants with DMD or BMD. All studied different interventions, and meta‐analysis was not possible. We found no studies for XLDCM. None of the trials reported cardiac function as improved or stable cardiac versus deteriorated. The randomised first part of a two‐part study of perindopril (N = 28) versus placebo (N = 27) in boys with DMD with normal heart function at baseline showed no difference in the number of participants with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) of less than 45% after three years of therapy (n = 1 in each group; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.77). This result is uncertain because of study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. In a non‐randomised follow‐up study, after 10 years, more participants who had received placebo from the beginning had reduced LVEF% (less than 45%). Adverse event rates were similar between the placebo and treatment groups (low‐certainty evidence). A study comparing treatment with lisinopril versus losartan in 23 boys newly diagnosed with Duchenne cardiomyopathy showed that after 12 months, both were equally effective in preserving or improving LVEF% (lisinopril 54.6% (standard deviation (SD) 5.19), losartan 55.2% (SD 7.19); mean difference (MD) −0.60% CI −6.67 to 5.47: N = 16). The certainty of evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and study limitations (risk of bias). Two participants in the losartan group were withdrawn due to adverse events: one participant developed an allergic reaction, and a second exceeded the safety standard with a fall in ejection fraction greater than 10%. Authors reported no other adverse events related to the medication (N = 22; very low‐certainty evidence). A study comparing idebenone versus placebo in 21 boys with DMD showed little or no difference in mean change in cardiac function between the two groups from baseline to 12 months; for fractional shortening the mean change was 1.4% (SD 4.1) in the idebenone group and 1.6% (SD 2.6) in the placebo group (MD −0.20%, 95% CI −3.07 to 2.67, N = 21), and for ejection fraction the mean change was −1.9% (SD 9.8) in the ideb none group and 0.4% (SD 5.5) in the placebo group (MD −2.30%, 95% CI −9.18 to 4.58, N = 21). The certainty of evidence was very low because of study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reported adverse events were similar between the treatment and placebo groups (low‐certainty evidence). A multicentre controlled study added eplerenone or placebo to 42 patients with DMD with early cardiomyopathy but preserved left ventricular function already established on ACEI or ARB therapy. Results showed that eplerenone slowed the rate of decline of magnetic resonance (MR)‐assessed left ventricular circumferential strain at 12 months (eplerenone group median 1.0%, interquartile range (IQR) 0.3 to −2.2; placebo group median 2.2%, IQR 1.3 to −3.1%; P = 0.020). The median decline in LVEF over the same period was also less in the eplerenone group (−1.8%, IQR −2.9 to 6.0) than in the placebo group (−3.7%, IQR −10.8 to 1.0; P = 0.032). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to very low for study limitations and serious imprecision. Serious adverse events were reported in two patients given placebo but none in the treatment group (very low‐certainty evidence). A randomised placebo‐controlled study of subcutaneous growth hormone in 16 participants with DMD or BMD showed an increase in left ventricular mass after three months' treatment but no significant improvement in cardiac function. The evidence was of very low certainty due to imprecision, indirectness, and study limitations. There were no clinically significant adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). Some studies were at risk of bias, and all were small. Therefore, although there is some evidence from non‐randomised data to support the prophylactic use of perindopril for cardioprotection ahead of detectable cardiomyopathy, and for lisinopril or losartan plus eplerenone once cardiomyopathy is detectable, this must be considered of very low certainty. Findings from non‐randomised studies, some of which have been long term, have led to the use of these drugs in daily clinical practice. Authors' conclusions Based on the available evidence from RCTs, early treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be comparably beneficial for people with a dystrophinopathy; however, the certainty of evidence is very low. Very low‐certainty evidence indicates that adding eplerenone might give additional benefit when early cardiomyopathy is detected. No clinically meaningful effect was seen for growth hormone or idebenone, although the certainty of the evidence is also very low. Plain language summary Preventing and treating heart complications in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and X‐linked dilated cardiomyopathy Review question What are the effects of treatments used to prevent or treat heart complications in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and X‐linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM)? Background The protein dystrophin is essential for muscles to work normally. DMD, BMD and XLDCM are inherited muscle diseases caused by changes in the gene that controls production of dystrophin. People with these conditions develop muscle wasting and weakness. In the heart, a lack of dystrophin causes muscle damage and scarring, which over time causes the heart to fail. Eventually the heart chambers enlarge, which is known as dilated cardiomyopathy. This serious complication can be a cause of death. There are a number of possible treatments for heart problems in these muscle conditions. One option is to reduce the workload of the heart with drugs that lower blood pressure (angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors, ACE inhibitors) or slow the heart rate (beta blockers or ivabradine). Another approach is to reduce muscle damage with antioxidants (e.g. idebenone) or medicines that target inflammation (e.g. corticosteroids). Recently, drugs that increase dystrophin have been developed, including ataluren and eteplirsen. Study characteristics Cochrane Review authors collected all relevant studies to answer their review question. They se rched for trials looking to prevent or treat heart complications in people with DMD, BMD or XLDCM. They limited the review to trials that randomly assign participants to one treatment or another, which usually provide the best evidence. They identified five small trials, with a total of 205 participants. ‐ A three‐year study of perindopril versus placebo (an inactive pill) to prevent heart complications in 57 boys with DMD. The randomised trial was followed by two years of open treatment, then a follow‐up study of 10 years when all children received perindopril. ‐ A one‐year study of lisinopril versus losartan in 23 patients with DMD and newly diagnosed heart complications. ‐ A one‐year study of idebenone versus placebo in 21 boys with DMD, which the manufacturer funded. ‐ A one‐year study of eplerenone versus placebo in 42 patients with DMD who already had heart complications, which the manufacturer partly funded. ‐ A three‐month study of growth hormone versus placebo in 10 patients with DMD or BMD. Key results and certainty of the evidence Based on the available evidence from RCTs, early treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may help people with DMD. In boys with early heart involvement, the effect of ACE inhibitor and ARB may be equivalent; however, the evidence is very uncertain. Findings from non‐randomised studies, some of which have been long term, have led to the use of these drugs in daily clinical practice. Very low‐certainty evidence indicates that adding eplerenone might give additional benefit in DMD when early cardiomyopathy is detected. We did not see a clinically meaningful effect for growth hormone or idebenone in the studies examined, although the certainty of the evidence was also very low. The trials provided only low or very low‐certainty evidence on side effects. Overall, the numbers of patients in each of these studies was small, and some studies had limitations that might have affected the results, so we are very uncertain about the results. The evidence is current to October 2017.	10.1002/14651858.CD009068.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	515	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009068.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Surgical portosystemic shunts versus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhosis	Brand MP, L.  Ede, C. J.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Variceal haemorrhage that is refractory or recurs after pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy requires a portal decompression shunt (either surgical shunts or radiologic shunt, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)). TIPS has become the shunt of choice; however, is it the preferred option? This review assesses evidence for the comparisons of surgical portosystemic shunts versus TIPS for variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of surgical portosystemic shunts versus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for treatment of refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science. We also searched on‐line trial registries, reference lists of relevant articles, and proceedings of relevant associations for trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (date of search 8 March 2018). Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing surgical portosystemic shunts versus TIPS for the treatment of refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials and extracted data using methodological standards expected by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias according to domains and risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We found four randomised clinical trials including 496 adult participants diagnosed with variceal haemorrhage due to cirrhotic portal hypertension. The overall risk of bias in all the trials was judged at high risk. All the trials were conducted in the United States of America (USA). Two of the trials randomised participants to selective surgical shunts versus TIPS. The other two trials randomised participants to non‐selective surgical shunts versus TIPS. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was by clinical and laboratory findings. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in all‐cause mortality at 30 days between surgical portosystemic shunts compared with TIPS (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.99; participants = 496; studies = 4). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in encephalopathy between surgical shunts compared with TIPS (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; participants = 496; studies = 4). We found evidence suggesting an increase in the occurrence of the following harms in the TIPS group compared with surgical shunts: all‐cause mortality at five years (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90; participants = 496; studies = 4); variceal rebleeding (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; participants = 496; studies = 4); reinterventions (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28; participants = 496; studies = 4); and shunt occlusion (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.51; participants = 496; studies = 4). We could not perform an analysis of health‐related quality of life but available evidence appear to suggest improved health‐related quality of life in people who received surgical shunt compared with TIPS. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all‐cause mortality at 30 days and five years, irreversible shunt occlusion, and encephalopathy to very low because of high risk of bias (due to lack of blinding); inconsistency (due to heterogeneity); imprecision (due to small sample sizes of the individual trials and few events); and publication bias (few trials reporting outcomes). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for variceal rebleeding and reintervention to very low because of high risk of bias (due to lack of blinding); imprecision (due to small sample sizes of the individual trials and few events); and publication bias (few trials reporting outcomes). The small sample sizes and few events did not allow us to produce meaningful trial sequential monitoring boundaries, suggesting plausible random errors in our estimates. Authors' conclusions We found evidence suggesting that surgical portosystemic shunts may have benefit over TIPS for treatment of refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Given the very low‐certainty of the available evidence and risks of random errors in our analyses, we have very little confidence in our review findings. Plain language summary Surgical shunts versus radiologic shunt for variceal haemorrhage in people with chronic disease of the liver Background Varices are enlarged thin walled vessels found in the walls of the oesophagus and stomach of people with high blood pressure in the portal circulation (blood vessels supplying the liver with blood from the bowels). Bleeding from varices are not uncommon and maybe life‐threatening. The first‐line treatment of this bleeding is with medications and endoscopy (use of a long tube fitted with camera to locate and occlude the varices with elastic bands). Most people will respond to the first‐line treatment, but a few will continue to bleed or have repeat bleeding. This later group will require further treatments in the form of shunts (tubes that divert blood from portal circulation direct to the heart). There are two types of shunts; one that is created through a surgical operation and called surgical shunt, the other is created with the help of an ultrasound machine and called radiologic shunt. Both types of shunts have their benefits and harms. This review was done to determine whether surgical shunts are better than radiologic shunt in treating persistent and repeat bleeding due to varices in people with cirrhosis (chronic disease of the liver in which normal liver cells are replaced by hard scar). Study characteristics We found four randomised clinical trials in which 496 adult participants were allowed to receive either a surgical shunt or a radiologic shunt. There were problems with the design of the trials as they had small number of participants and used different shunt types. We judged all four trials at high risk of bias (trials may have overestimated the true effect of shunts treatment). Key results We found no difference in the number of participants who died within 30 days of treatment, and the number that developed encephalopathy (disease of the brain due to toxins bypassing the liver to reach the brain), when surgical shunts were compared with radiologic shunt. We found evidence suggesting more harms with radiologic shunt when we considered the number of participants that died five years after treatment; or had repeat bleeding; or required repeated treatment; or had shunt blockage; that appeared to be more in the radiologic shunt group. Conclusions Surgical shunts appear to be better than radiologic shunt for treating persistent and repeated bleeding due to varices in people with liver cirrhosis. Given the very low certainty of the evidence due to problems with design of the trials and inadequate number of participants, we are unsure if our conclusion is correct. Future trials with better design and adequate number of participants will likely produce results that are reliable.	10.1002/14651858.CD001023.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	511	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001023.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) of zonisamide, used as an add‐on treatment for focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drug. This is an updated version of the Cochrane review previously published in 2013. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of zonisamide, when used as an add‐on treatment for people with focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Search methods For this update, on 4 September 2017, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP . We searched SCOPUS on 13 February 2013, but this is no longer necessary, because RCTs and quasi‐RCTs in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. In addition, we contacted Eisai Limited (makers and licensees of zonisamide) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, in which add‐on zonisamide was compared with placebo or another antiepileptic drug in people with focal epilepsy, uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and assessed the quality of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was at least a 50% reduction in total seizure frequency; the secondary outcomes were (1) tolerability; and (2) adverse effects. We used an intention‐to‐treat approach for our primary analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RRs) for each outcome. We displayed a summary of the estimates of effects and quality of the evidence for each outcome in a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included eight studies (1636 participants). The overall RR with 95% confidence interval (CI) for at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo for 300 mg to 500 mg/day of zonisamide was 1.90 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.22; 7 trials, 1371 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The RR for 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo for any dose of zonisamide (100 mg to 500 mg/day) was 1.86 (95% CI 1.60 to 2.17; 7 trials, 1429 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was six (95% CI 4.1 to 6.8) for this outcome. Two trials provided evidence of a dose‐response relationship for this outcome. The RR for treatment withdrawal for 300 mg to 500 mg/day of zonisamide compared to placebo was 1.59 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.13; 6 trials, 1099 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and for 100 mg to 500 mg/day was 1.44 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; 6 trials, 1156 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was 15 (95% CI 9.3 to 36.7). The CIs of the following adverse effects indicated that they were significantly associated with zonisamide: ataxia RR 3.85 (99% CI 1.36 to 10.93; 4 trials, 734 participants; low‐quality evidence); somnolence RR 1.52 (99% CI 1.00 to 2.31; 8 trials, 1636 participants; moderate‐quality evidence); agitation RR 2.35 (99% CI 1.05 to 5.27; 4 trials, 598 participants; low‐quality evidence); and anorexia RR 2.74 (99% CI 1.64 to 4.60; 6 trials, 1181 participants; low‐quality evidence). Across the eight studies, we rated risk of bias domains at low or unclear risk of bias apart from two studies which we rated at high risk of attrition bias. Five of the eight studies were sponsored by the drug companies that produced zonisamide. Authors' conclusions When used as an add‐on treatment in people with focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drugs, moderate‐quality evidence found that zonisamide was more successful than placebo at reducing the frequency of seizures by at least 50%. We were unable to identify minimum effective and maximum tolerated doses. The included trials evaluated a maximum stable‐dose phase of 18 weeks, so results cannot be used to confirm longer periods of efficacy in seizure control. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other seizure types or epilepsy syndromes. Plain language summary Zonisamide add‐on for focal epilepsy that does not respond to other medication Background Around 70% of patients with epilepsy can become seizure‐free with antiepileptic drug treatment. The remaining 30% of people with epilepsy may not respond to antiepileptic drugs, and may still experience seizures. Older drugs do not prevent seizures for everyone, and they have adverse effects. New drugs have been developed to try to treat people who do not respond to the older drugs, and to try to limit the adverse effects. These newer drugs may be taken along with the patient's existing medication, as an 'add‐on' treatment. Key results Searches of six databases found eight randomised controlled trials (1636 participants), which compared the addition of the antiepileptic drug zonisamide to one or more antiepileptic drugs to a placebo, for a period of 12 weeks, in people with uncontrolled focal epilepsy. Taking all the evidence of the trials into account, we found that seizure frequency was significantly reduced for people with focal epilepsy if zonisamide was added to their usual treatment. Participants treated with 300 mg to 500 mg/day of zonisamide were twice as likely as people given placebo tablets in addition to their usual treatment, to experience at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of their seizures. However, adding zonisamide to their usual treatment was associated with an increase in adverse effects, such as problems with co‐ordination (ataxia), drowsiness (somnolence), agitation, and anorexia. Quality of the evidence We assessed that the risk of bias within the individual trials was low, or we did not have enough information to decide. Five of the eight studies were sponsored by the drug companies that produce zonisamide. We rated the quality of the evidence for the main outcomes as moderate. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. More research is needed that concentrates on examining the response of different doses of zonisamide. The evidence is current to September 2017.	10.1002/14651858.CD001416.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	474	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001416.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

H.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a non‐atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small‐ and medium‐sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Stem cell therapy is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischemic ulcers or rest pain. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of stem cell therapy in individuals with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 17 October 2017. The review authors searched the European grey literature OpenGrey Database, screened reference lists of relevant studies and contacted study authors. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of stem cell therapy in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). Data collection and analysis The review authors (DC, DM, FN) independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis. Main results We only included one RCT (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cell derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care in this review. We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy (bone marrow source) versus stem cell therapy (umbilical cord source), stem cell therapy (any source) versus pharmacological treatment and stem cell therapy (any source) versus sympathectomy. Ulcer healing was assessed in the form of ulcer size. The mean ulcer area decreased more in the stem cell implantation group: from 5.04 cm 2 (standard deviation (SD) 0.70) to 1.48 cm 2 (SD 0.56) compared with the control group: mean ulcer size area decreased from 4.68 cm 2 (SD 0.62) to 3.59 cm 2 (SD 0.14); mean difference (MD) ‐2.11 cm 2 , 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.49 to ‐1.73; 1 study, 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence. Pain‐free walking distance showed more of an improvement in the stem cell implantation group: from mean of 38.33 meters (SD 17.68) to 284.44 meters (SD 212.12) compared with the control group: mean walking distance increased from 35.66 meters (SD 19.79) to 78.22 meters (SD 35.35); MD 206.22 meters, 95% CI 65.73 to 346.71; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence. Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation‐free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. The quality of evidence was classified as very low, with only one study, small numbers of participants, high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. Authors' conclusions Very low‐quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow‐derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improvement in the pain‐free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High‐quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed. Plain language summary Stem cell therapy for treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) Background Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a condition characterized by recurring progressive inflammation and clotting in small‐ and medium‐sized arteries and veins of the hands and feet. Its cause is unknown, but it is most common in men with a history of tobacco use. It is responsible for ulcers and extreme pain in the limbs of young smokers. In many cases, mainly in patients with the most severe form, there is no possibility of improving the condition with surgery, and therefore, alternative treatments are used. Stem cell therapy is an experimental treatment performed through the implantation of cells (from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood etc.) which are capable of becoming new blood vessels, improving local circulation and contributing to the healing of ulcers and relieving rest pain. This review assessed the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in the treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). Key results Only one randomized controlled study (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cells derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care was included in this review (most recent search was 17 October 2017). We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy from different sources, stem cell therapy versus drug treatment and stem cell therapy versus sympathectomy (surgical cutting of a sympathetic nerve). The results showed a decrease in ulcer size and improvement in pain‐free walking distance in the group receiving the stem cell implantation compared with the group receiving placebo and standard wound dressing care. Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation‐free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. Quality of the evidence We classified the quality of evidence as very low, because there was only one study, small numbers of participants, and high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. Conclusions Very low‐quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow‐derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improving the pain‐free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High‐quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.	10.1002/14651858.CD012794.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	507	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012794.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Successful treatment of recession‐type defects is based on the use of predictable root coverage periodontal plastic surgery (RCPPS) procedures. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2009. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of different root coverage procedures in the treatment of single and multiple recession‐type defects. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 15 January 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 15 January 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 15 January 2018), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 15 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials (15 January 2018). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only of at least 6 months' duration evaluating recession areas (Miller's Class I or II ≥ 3 mm) and treated by means of RCPPS procedures. Data collection and analysis Screening of eligible studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently and in duplicate. Authors were contacted for any missing information. We expressed results as random‐effects models using mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the body of evidence of our main comparisons. Main results We included 48 RCTs in the review. Of these, we assessed one as at low risk of bias, 12 as at high risk of bias and 35 as at unclear risk of bias. The results indicated a greater reduction in gingival recession for subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) + coronally advanced flap (CAF) compared to guided tissue regeneration with resorbable membranes (GTR rm) + CAF (MD ‐0.37 mm; 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.13, P = 0.002; 3 studies; 98 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in gingival recession reduction between acellular dermal matrix grafts (ADMG) + CAF and SCTG + CAF or between enamel matrix protein (EMP) + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Regarding clinical attachment level changes, GTR rm + CAF promoted additional gains compared to SCTG + CAF (MD 0.35; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.63, P = 0.02; 3 studies; 98 participants; low‐quality evidence) but there was insufficient evidence of a difference between ADMG + CAF and SCTG + CAF or between EMP + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Greater gains in the keratinized tissue were found for SCTG + CAF when compared to EMP + CAF (MD ‐1.06 mm; 95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.76, P < 0.00001; 2 studies; 62 participants; low‐quality evidence), and SCTG + CAF when compared to GTR rm + CAF (MD ‐1.77 mm; 95% CI ‐2.66 to ‐0.89, P < 0.0001; 3 studies; 98 participants; very low‐quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in keratinized tissue gain between ADMG + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Few data exist on aesthetic condition change related to patients' opinion and patients' preference for a specific procedure. Authors' conclusions Subepithelial connective tissue grafts, coronally advanced flap alone or associated with other biomaterial and guided tissue regeneration may be used as root coverage procedures for treating localised or multiple recession‐type defects. The available evidence base indicates that in cases where both root coverage and gain in the width of keratinized tissue are expected, the use of subepithelial connective tissue grafts shows a slight improvement in outcome. There is also some weak evidence suggesting that acellular dermal matrix grafts appear as the soft tissue substitute that may provide the most similar outcomes to those achieved by subepithelial connective tissue grafts. RCTs are necessary to identify possible factors associated with the prognosis of each RCPPS procedure. The potential impact of bias on these outcomes is unclear. Plain language summary Root coverage procedures for the treatment of localised and multiple recession‐type defects Review question The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of different surgical procedures to cover exposed tooth roots, when the gum tissue has receded away from the tooth. Background Receding gums (also known as gingival recession) is the gradual loss of gum tissue, and if left untreated it can result in exposure of the tooth root, between the gum and the tooth. It can involve one tooth (single recession‐type defect) or many teeth (multiple recession‐type defects). It can affect the look of the teeth, and is also linked to tooth sensitivity. Exposure of the tooth root can be treated by cosmetic surgery; techniques include grafting and gum regeneration. Grafting involves taking tissue from another place in the mouth and stitching it over the area of the exposed root. With gum regeneration, biomaterials are used to regenerate gum tissue without the need for taking it from the roof of the mouth. Procedures used in gum grafting and gum regeneration include: free gingival grafts, coronally advanced flaps, acellular dermal matrix grafts, laterally positioned flaps and guided tissue regeneration. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2009. Study characteristics Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 15 January 2018. A total of 48 randomised controlled trials on 1227 adults were included with five studies evaluating multiple recession‐type defects and the rest single gingival recessions. Most trials followed participants for 6 months to 12 months. The review looked at different interventions: free gingival grafts (FGG), coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone or associated to acellular dermal matrix grafts (ADMG), enamel matrix protein (EMP), guided tissue regeneration with resorbable membranes (GTR rm), guided tissue regeneration with non‐resorbable membranes (GTR nrm), GTR rm associated with bone substitutes, platelet‐rich plasma or fibrin (PRP or PRF), growth factors (rhPDGF‐BB) associated to bone substitutes (b‐TCP), subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) or xenogeneic collagen matrix (XCM). We did not find any trials evaluating laterally positioned flaps (LPF). Key results The results of this review have shown that most root coverage periodontal plastic surgery procedures led to gains in reduction of gingival recession. However, we are uncertain about which intervention is the most effective as all studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias. Preferably, subepithelial connective tissue grafts, coronally advanced flap alone or associated with another graft or biomaterial and guided tissue regeneration can be used as root coverage procedures for treating recession‐type defects. Limited data exist on how these interventions affect the appearance of the teeth. Adverse effects reported in the studies included discomfort and pain, but these were mainly related to the site where the tissue graft was taken, and occurred mainly within the first week after surgery with no influence on root coverage outcomes. Further research is needed on the results to be achieved from each root coverage periodontal plastic procedure. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low mainly due to problems with the design of the studies.	10.1002/14651858.CD007161.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	493	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007161.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

The only known cure for this disease is delivery. Some obstetricians advocate early delivery to ensure that the development of serious maternal complications, such as eclampsia (fits) and kidney failure are prevented. Others prefer a more expectant approach, delaying delivery in an attempt to reduce the mortality and morbidity for the child that is associated with being born too early. Objectives To evaluate the comparative benefits and risks of a policy of early delivery by induction of labour or by caesarean section, after sufficient time has elapsed to administer corticosteroids, and allow them to take effect; with a policy of delaying delivery (expectant care) for women with severe pre‐eclampsia between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) on 27 November 2017, and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing the two intervention strategies for women with early onset, severe pre‐eclampsia. Trials reported in an abstract were eligible for inclusion, as were cluster‐trial designs. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence for specified outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results We included six trials, with a total of 748 women in this review. All trials included women in whom there was no overriding indication for immediate delivery in the fetal or maternal interest. Half of the trials were at low risk of bias for methods of randomisation and allocation concealment; and four trials were at low risk for selective reporting. For most other domains, risk of bias was unclear. There were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on most outcomes for the mother. Two studies reported on maternal deaths; neither study reported any deaths (two studies; 320 women; low‐quality evidence). It was uncertain whether interventionist care reduced eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 15.58; two studies; 359 women) or pulmonary oedema (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.00; two studies; 415 women), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was very low. Evidence from two studies suggested little or no clear difference between the interventionist and expectant care groups for HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.91; two studies; 359 women; low‐quality evidence). No study reported on stroke. With the addition of data from two studies for this update, there was now evidence to suggest that interventionist care probably made little or no difference to the incidence of caesarean section (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; six studies; 745 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 63%). For the baby, there was insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions about the effects on perinatal deaths (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; three studies; 343 women; low‐quality evidence). Babies whose mothers had been allocated to the interventionist group had more intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.29; two studies; 537 women; moderate‐quality evidence), more respiratory distress caused by hyaline membrane disease (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.81; two studies; 133 women), required more ventilation (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.02; two studies; 300 women), and were more likely to have a lower gestation at birth (mean difference (MD) ‐9.91 days, 95% CI ‐16.37 to ‐3.45 days; four studies; 425 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 31.74; I² = 76%). However, babies whose mothers had been all cated to the interventionist group were no more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.60; three studies; 400 infants; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.05; I² = 84%). Babies born to mothers in the interventionist groups were more likely to have a longer stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (MD 7.38 days, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 15.20 days; three studies; 400 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 40.93, I² = 85%) and were less likely to be small‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.61; three studies; 400 women). There were no clear differences between the two strategies for any other outcomes. Authors' conclusions This review suggested that an expectant approach to the management of women with severe early onset pre‐eclampsia may be associated with decreased morbidity for the baby. However, this evidence was based on data from only six trials. Further large, high‐quality trials are needed to confirm or refute these findings, and establish if this approach is safe for the mother. Plain language summary Interventionist versus expectant care for severe pre‐eclampsia before term What is the issue? Women who develop pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) before 34 weeks of pregnancy (early onset) are at risk of severe complications, and even death. These involve the woman's liver, kidneys, and clotting system, and cause neurological disturbances, such as headache, visual disturbances, and fits. If the placenta is involved, this can cause growth restriction or reduced amniotic fluid, placing the baby at risk. Why is this important? The only known cure for pre‐eclampsia is delivery of the baby. Being born too early can in itself have problems for the baby, even with the administration of corticosteroids 24 to 48 hours beforehand, to help mature the lungs. Some hospitals follow a policy of early delivery, within 24 to 48 hours, called interventionist management, whilst others prefer to delay delivery until it is no longer possible to safely stabilise the woman's condition, called expectant management. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence in November 2017 and identified six randomised trials. This review included six trials that randomly assigned women to a policy of interventionist management or expectant management when presenting with severe pre‐eclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy. A total of 748 women were included in these six trials. Babies born to women allocated to an interventionist approach were probably more likely to experience adverse effects such as bleeding in the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage). They may also have been more likely to require ventilation, have a longer stay in the neonatal unit, have a lower gestation at birth in days, and weigh less at birth than those babies born to women allocated to an expectant management approach. There was insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects on perinatal deaths. Babies whose mothers had been allocated to the interventionist group were no more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care. There were no maternal deaths in the two studies that reported this outcome. The evidence was very low‐quality for the outcome of fits or convulsions (eclampsia), or of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), and so it was uncertain whether interventionist care made any clear difference to the mothers' health. Evidence from two studies suggested little or no clear difference between the interventionist and expectant care groups for a severe form of pre‐eclampsia, which affects the liver and blood clotting, called HELLP syndrome, which stands for haemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes (a sign of liver damage), and low platelets (platelets help the blood to clot). None of the studies reported on the incidence of stroke in the mother. With the addition of data from two studies for this update, there was now evidence to suggest that interventionist care probably made little or no difference to the caesarean section rate. What does this ean? In the absence of an over‐riding maternal or fetal indication for immediate delivery, delay may be more beneficial for the baby. However, there were insufficient data to enable us to draw reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on most outcomes for the mother, and hence the maternal safety of an expectant approach. This evidence was based on data from only six trials. Further large trials with long‐term follow‐up of the children are needed to confirm or refute whether expectant care is better than early delivery for women who suffer from severe pre‐eclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy.	10.1002/14651858.CD003106.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	531	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003106.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Intrauterine administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction	Craciunas LT, N.  Raine‐Fenning, N.  Coomarasamy, A.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Embryo Transfer  Abortion, Spontaneous [etiology]  Adult  Chorionic Gonadotropin [*administration & dosage]  Female  Humans  Infertility, Female [*drug therapy]  Live Birth  Pregnancy  Pregnancy Rate  Reproductive Control Agents [*administration & dosage]  Uterus	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Most women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment will reach the stage of embryo transfer (ET), but the proportion of embryos that can be successfully implanted after ET has remained small since the mid‐1990s. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone that is synthesised and released by the syncytiotrophoblast and has a fundamental role in embryo implantation and the early stages of pregnancy. Intrauterine administration of hCG via ET catheter during a mock procedure around the time of ET is a novel approach that has been suggested to improve the outcomes of assisted reproduction. Objectives To investigate whether intrauterine (intracavity) administration of hCG (IC‐hCG) around the time of ET improves clinical outcomes in subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction. Search methods We performed searches on 9 January 2018 using Cochrane methods. Selection criteria We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IC‐hCG around the time of ET, irrespective of language and country of origin. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data from studies, and attempted to contact study authors when data were missing. We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 . We assessed evidence quality using GRADE methods. Primary outcomes were live birth and miscarriage; secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate and complications. Main results Seventeen RCTs investigated the effects of IC‐hCG administration for 4751 subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction. IC‐hCG was administered in variable doses at different times before the ET. hCG was obtained from the urine of pregnant women or from cell cultures using recombinant DNA technology. Most studies (12/17) were at high risk of bias in at least one of the seven domains assessed. Common problems were unclear reporting of study methods and lack of blinding. The main limitations for evidence quality were high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For analyses of live birth and clinical pregnancy, there was considerable heterogeneity (I² > 75%) and therefore we present subgroups for dosage and stage of ET. Exploration for sources of heterogeneity revealed two key prespecified variables as important determinants: stage of ET (cleavage vs blastocyst stage) and dose of IC‐hCG (< 500 international units (IU) vs ≥ 500 IU). We performed meta‐analyses within subgroups defined by stage of embryo and dose of IC‐hCG. Live birth rates among women having cleavage‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose < 500 IU compared to women having cleavage‐stage ET without IC‐hCG showed no benefit of the intervention and would be consistent with no substantive difference or disadvantage of indeterminate magnitude (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.01; one RCT; 280 participants; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). In a clinic with a live birth rate of 49% per cycle, use of IC‐hCG < 500 IU would be associated with a live birth rate ranging from 28% to 50%. Results show an increase in live birth rate in the subgroup of women undergoing cleavage‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose ≥ 500 IU compared to women having cleavage‐stage ET without IC‐hCG (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.87; three RCTs; 914 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). At a clinic with a live birth rate of 27% per cycle, use of IC‐hCG ≥ 500 IU would be associated with a live birth rate ranging from 36% to 51%. Results show no substantive differences in live birth among women having blastocyst‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose ≥ 500 IU compared to women having blastocyst‐stage ET without IC‐hCG (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04; two RCTs; 1666 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). At a clinic with a live birth rate of 36% per cycle, use of IC‐hCG ≥ 500 IU would be associated with a live birth rate ranging from 29% to 38%. Evidence for clinical pregnancy among women having cleavage‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose < 50 IU showed no benefit of the intervention and would be consistent with no substantive difference or disadvantage of indeterminate magnitude (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.10; one RCT; 280 participants; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Results show an increase in clinical pregnancy rate in the subgroup of women having cleavage‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose ≥ 500 IU compared to women having cleavage‐stage ET without IC‐hCG (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.68; 12 RCTs; 2186 participants; I² = 18%; moderate‐quality evidence). Results show no substantive differences in clinical pregnancy among women having blastocyst‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose ≥ 500 IU (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.15; four RCTs; 2091 participants; I² = 42%; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to women having blastocyst‐stage ET with no IC‐hCG. No RCTs investigated blastocyst‐stage ET with an IC‐hCG dose < 500 IU. We are uncertain whether miscarriage was influenced by intrauterine hCG administration (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.35; 11 RCTs; 3927 participants; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Reported complications were ectopic pregnancy (four RCTs; 1073 participants; four events overall), heterotopic pregnancy (one RCT; 495 participants; one event), intrauterine death (three RCTs; 1078 participants; 22 events), and triplets (one RCT; 48 participants; three events). Events were few, and very low‐quality evidence was insufficient to permit conclusions to be drawn. Authors' conclusions There is moderate quality evidence that women undergoing cleavage‐stage transfer using an IC‐hCG dose ≥ 500 IU have an improved live birth rate. There is insufficient evidence for IC‐hCG treatment for blastocyst transfer. There should be further trials with live birth as the primary outcome to identify the groups of women who would benefit the most from this intervention. There was no evidence that miscarriage was reduced following IC‐hCG administration, irrespective of embryo stage at transfer or dose of IC‐hCG. Events were too few to allow conclusions to be drawn with regard to other complications. Plain language summary The effect of administering pregnancy hormone into the womb of subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction Review question Does administering pregnancy hormone into the womb of subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction provide any benefit? Background Subfertility affects 15% of couples and is defined as the inability to become pregnant naturally following 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Assisted reproduction refers to procedures involving handling of both sperm and eggs in the laboratory to create embryos to be transferred into the womb (embryo transfer (ET)). Administering natural or synthetic pregnancy hormone into the womb of subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment is a novel approach that might increase the chance of having a baby. Study characteristics We evaluated 17 studies (4751 women) comparing administration of pregnancy hormone versus no hormone. The natural or synthetic hormone was administered at variable doses at different times before ET. Key results Live birth rates in women having day three ET with human chorionic gonadotropin administered into the uterus (IC‐hCG) at a dose < 500 IU compared to women having day three ET without pregnancy hormone showed no benefit of the intervention and would be consistent with no substantive difference or disadvantage of indeterminate magnitude (very low‐quality evidence: one study; 280 women). In a clinic with a live birth rate of 49% per cycle following day three ET, use of a pregnancy hormone dose < 500 IU would be associated with a live birth rate varying from 28% to 50%. Live birth rate was increased in a subgroup of women having day three ET with a pregnancy hormone dose of 500 IU or greater compared to women having day three ET without pregnancy hormone (moderate‐quality evidence: three studies; 914 women). At a clinic with a live birth rate of 27% per cycle, use of a pregnancy hormone dose of 500 IU r greater would be associated with a live birth rate varying from 36% to 51%. Trial results show no substantive differences in live birth among women having day five ET with a pregnancy hormone dose of 500 IU or greater compared to women having day five ET without pregnancy hormone (moderate‐quality evidence: two studies; 1666 women). At a clinic with a live birth rate of 36% per cycle, use of a pregnancy hormone dose of 500 IU or greater would be associated with a live birth rate varying from 29% to 38%. We are uncertain whether administration of pregnancy hormone into the womb at any dose or time affected miscarriage (very low‐quality evidence: 11 studies; 3927 women). Evidence for clinical pregnancy among women having day three ET with a pregnancy hormone dose < 500 IU showed no benefit of the intervention and would be consistent with no substantive difference or disadvantage of indeterminate magnitude (very low‐quality evidence: one study; 280 women). The clinical pregnancy rate was increased in the subgroup of women having day three ET with a pregnancy hormone dose of 500 IU or greater compared to women having day three ET without pregnancy hormone (moderate‐quality evidence: 12 studies; 2186 women). Trial results show no substantive difference in clinical pregnancy among women having day five ET with a pregnancy hormone dose of 500 IU or greater compared to women having day five ET with no pregnancy hormone (moderate‐quality evidence: four studies; 2091 women). No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigated day five ET with a pregnancy hormone dose < 500 IU. Other complications reported in the included studies were ectopic pregnancy (where the embryo develops outside the womb), heterotopic pregnancy (where embryos develop inside and outside the womb), foetal death, and triplets. Events were few, and insufficient evidence of very low quality does not permit us to determine whether there were differences between groups. There should be further trials with live birth as the primary outcome to identify the groups of women who would benefit the most from this intervention. Quality of the evidence Evidence quality varied from very low to moderate depending on the outcome. The main limitations for the overall quality of the evidence were high risk of bias and serious imprecision.	10.1002/14651858.CD011537.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	533	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011537.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

C.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Pelvic Floor  Biofeedback, Psychology  Exercise Therapy [*methods]  Female  Humans  Muscle Contraction [*physiology]  Perineum  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic  Urinary Incontinence [*rehabilitation]  Urinary Incontinence, Stress [rehabilitation]	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the most commonly used physical therapy treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). It is sometimes also recommended for mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) and, less commonly, urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of PFMT for women with urinary incontinence (UI) in comparison to no treatment, placebo or sham treatments, or other inactive control treatments; and summarise the findings of relevant economic evaluations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 12 February 2018), which contains trials identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in women with SUI, UUI or MUI (based on symptoms, signs or urodynamics). One arm of the trial included PFMT. Another arm was a no treatment, placebo, sham or other inactive control treatment arm. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias. We extracted and cross‐checked data. A third review author resolved disagreements. We processed data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We subgrouped trials by diagnosis of UI. We undertook formal meta‐analysis when appropriate. Main results The review included 31 trials (10 of which were new for this update) involving 1817 women from 14 countries. Overall, trials were of small‐to‐moderate size, with follow‐ups generally less than 12 months and many were at moderate risk of bias. There was considerable variation in the intervention's content and duration, study populations and outcome measures. There was only one study of women with MUI and only one study with UUI alone, with no data on cure, cure or improvement, or number of episodes of UI for these subgroups. Symptomatic cure of UI at the end of treatment: compared with no treatment or inactive control treatments, women with SUI who were in the PFMT groups were eight times more likely to report cure (56% versus 6%; risk ratio (RR) 8.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.68 to 19.07; 4 trials, 165 women; high‐quality evidence). For women with any type of UI, PFMT groups were five times more likely to report cure (35% versus 6%; RR 5.34, 95% CI 2.78 to 10.26; 3 trials, 290 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Symptomatic cure or improvement of UI at the end of treatment: compared with no treatment or inactive control treatments, women with SUI who were in the PFMT groups were six times more likely to report cure or improvement (74% versus 11%; RR 6.33, 95% CI 3.88 to 10.33; 3 trials, 242 women; moderate‐quality evidence). For women with any type of UI, PFMT groups were two times more likely to report cure or improvement than women in the control groups (67% versus 29%; RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.64 to 3.47; 2 trials, 166 women; moderate‐quality evidence). UI‐specific symptoms and quality of life (QoL) at the end of treatment: compared with no treatment or inactive control treatments, women with SUI who were in the PFMT group were more likely to report significant improvement in UI symptoms (7 trials, 376 women; moderate‐quality evidence), and to report significant improvement in UI QoL (6 trials, 348 women; low‐quality evidence). For any type of UI, women in the PFMT group were more likely to report significant improvement in UI symptoms (1 trial, 121 women; moderate‐quality evidence) and to report significant improvement in UI QoL (4 trials, 258 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Finally, for women with mixed UI treated with PFMT, there was one small trial (12 women) reporting better QoL. Leakage episodes in 24 hours at the end of treatment : PFMT reduced leakage episodes by one in w men with SUI (mean difference (MD) 1.23 lower, 95% CI 1.78 lower to 0.68 lower; 7 trials, 432 women; moderate‐quality evidence) and in women with all types of UI (MD 1.00 lower, 95% CI 1.37 lower to 0.64 lower; 4 trials, 349 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Leakage on short clinic‐based pad tests at the end of treatment: women with SUI in the PFMT groups lost significantly less urine in short (up to one hour) pad tests. The comparison showed considerable heterogeneity but the findings still favoured PFMT when using a random‐effects model (MD 9.71 g lower, 95% CI 18.92 lower to 0.50 lower; 4 trials, 185 women; moderate‐quality evidence). For women with all types of UI, PFMT groups also reported less urine loss on short pad tests than controls (MD 3.72 g lower, 95% CI 5.46 lower to 1.98 lower; 2 trials, 146 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Women in the PFMT group were also more satisfied with treatment and their sexual outcomes were better. Adverse events were rare and, in the two trials that did report any, they were minor. The findings of the review were largely supported by the 'Summary of findings' tables, but most of the evidence was downgraded to moderate on methodological grounds. The exception was 'participant‐perceived cure' in women with SUI, which was rated as high quality. Authors' conclusions Based on the data available, we can be confident that PFMT can cure or improve symptoms of SUI and all other types of UI. It may reduce the number of leakage episodes, the quantity of leakage on the short pad tests in the clinic and symptoms on UI‐specific symptom questionnaires. The authors of the one economic evaluation identified for the Brief Economic Commentary reported that the cost‐effectiveness of PFMT looks promising. The findings of the review suggest that PFMT could be included in first‐line conservative management programmes for women with UI. The long‐term effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of PFMT needs to be further researched. Plain language summary Pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women Review question We wanted to find out if pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) helps women with urinary incontinence problems. We did this by comparing the effects of this training with no treatment, or with any inactive treatment (for example, advice on management with pads). We also summarised findings on costs and cost‐effectiveness. We searched for clinical trials up to 12 February 2018. Why is this question important? Stress incontinence is leaking of urine which cannot be easily controlled (if at all) when performing a physical activity. Physical activities could include coughing, sneezing, sporting activities or suddenly changing position. Urgency incontinence happens with a sudden, strong need to urinate. This can often lead to not making it to the toilet in time to urinate, resulting in leakage. Mixed incontinence is where someone has both stress and urgency incontinence. PFMT is a programme of exercise to improve pelvic floor muscle strength, endurance, power, relaxation or a combination of these. It is a widely used treatment for women with stress, urgency and mixed incontinence. How did we carry out the review of the evidence? The 31 included trials involved 1817 women from 14 countries. The studies included women with stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence. The women were allocated randomly to either receive or not receive PFMT and the effects were compared. We looked at whether the condition was 'cured,' or 'cured or improved.' We also looked at symptoms, the effect on quality of life (QoL) and the frequency and amount of urine lost. Study funding sources Eight studies were publicly funded. Three received grants from public and private sources. Two received grants from private sources, while two studies received no funding. Sixteen studies did not declare their funding sources. What we found The quality of the evidence we looked at was mostly moderate, which means we can have some confidence in the results. Cure of urinary incontinence after PFMT: omen with stress urinary incontinence in the PFMT group were, on average, eight times more likely to report being cured. Women with any type of urinary incontinence in the PFMT group were, on average, five times more likely to report being cured. Cure or improvement of urinary incontinence after PFMT: women with stress urinary incontinence in PFMT groups were, on average, six times more likely to report they were cured or improved. Women with all type of urinary incontinence in the PFMT group were roughly twice as likely to report they were cured or improved. Leakage episodes after PFMT: women with stress urinary incontinence and women with all types of urinary incontinence in the PFMT group had one fewer leakage episode in 24 hours. PFMT appeared to reduce leakage episodes in women with urgency urinary incontinence alone. For women with stress and all types of urinary incontinence, their incontinence symptoms and QoL were improved in the PFMT groups. Women were more satisfied with the PFMT treatment, while those in the control groups were more likely to seek further treatment. Negative side effects of performing PFMT were rare and, in the two trials that did report them, the side effects were minor. The authors of the one economic evaluation identified for the Brief Economic Commentary reported that the cost‐effectiveness of PFMT looks promising.	10.1002/14651858.CD005654.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	478	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005654.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for schizophrenia	Eslami Shahrbabaki MD, R.  Vali, L.  Sharafkhani, R.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a prevalence of about 1% among the general population. It is listed among the top 10 causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. Antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment. Piperacetazine has been reported to be as clinically effective as chlorpromazine, a well established 'benchmark' antipsychotic, for people with schizophrenia. However, the side effect profiles of these antipsychotics differ and it is important that an evidence base is available comparing the benefits, and potential harms of these two antipsychotics. Objectives To assess the clinical and side effects of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses in comparison with piperacetazine. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (6 June 2015 and 8 October 2018) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for people with schizophrenia, reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We found 12 records referring to six trials. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. We excluded one trial. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor. Only short‐term data were available. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; participants = 208; studies = 2; very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported change scores on the mental state scale Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); no clear difference was observed (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 0.61; participants = 182; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Chlorpromazine appears no worse or better than piperacetazine regarding adverse effects. In both treatment groups, around 60% of participants experienced some sort of adverse effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33; participants = 74; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence), with approximately 40% of these participants experiencing some parkinsonism‐type movement disorder (RR 0.95, CI 0.61 to 1.49; participants = 106; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence). No clear difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early for any reason was observed (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.56; participants = 256; studies = 4; very low‐quality evidence). No trial reported data for change in negative symptoms or economic costs. Authors' conclusions The results of this review show chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy, but data are based on very small numbers of participants and the evidence is very low quality. We can not make firm conclusions based on such data. Currently, should clinicians and people with schizophrenia need to choose between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine they should be aware there is no good quality evidence to base decisions. More high quality research is needed. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for schizophrenia Review question Is the antipsychotic drug, chlorpromazine, better or worse than the antipsychotic drug, piperacetazine, for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that severely disrupts a person's thought pr cesses and affects around 1% of the general population. Schizophrenia is listed among the top 10 causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have a lower life expectancy and an increased risk of suicide. There are two main types of symptoms, positive and negative. Common positive symptoms include delusions (beliefs that are not based in reality) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real). Negative symptoms include social withdrawal and lack of motivation and poor emotional response. Positive symptoms are usually of short duration and the negative symptoms can be long term. Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of antipsychotic drugs and psychological therapies. Chlorpromazine and piperacetazine are antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia, however, they both can also cause unpleasant side effects. This review aims to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the effectiveness and safety of both of these drugs. Searching for evidence A search for randomised controlled trials that could be relevant to this review was carried out on 6 June 2015, and another search was carried out 8 October 2018. This was achieved by searching the Specialised Register of Cochrane Schizophrenia. The 2015 search found six possible trials and we carefully checked these to see if we could include them in the review. The 2018 search found no new trials. Results Five trials, randomising a total of 343 participants met the review requirements for inclusion. These trials randomly allocated participants to receive either chlorpromazine or piperacetazine. Data were reported for participants' global and mental state after treatment, incidence of adverse effects and numbers leaving the trial early. However, we did not find any data concerning service use, functioning of participants or economic costs of these treatments. The overall results showed chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy and side effect profiles. However, these results are based on very low‐quality data. Conclusions The number of included studies and the sample size of participants included in this review is small, and the quality of data very low, so the results of this review are not conclusive and must be used with caution. Further research would be needed before decisions can be made regarding which drug is more effective.	10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	508	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema	Ferguson LF, M.  Vakirlis, E.  Kojima, R.  Sasaki, H.  Roberts, A.  Mori, R.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid‐sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted. Objectives To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema. Search methods We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long‐term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short‐term measurements (defined as less than three months follow‐up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate‐to‐severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study). Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate‐to‐severe eczema after short‐term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low‐quality evidence). When short‐term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate‐to‐severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (me n improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain. All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low‐quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes. Authors' conclusions The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long‐term control. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low‐quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low‐quality evidence). There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate‐to‐severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all. Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance. Plain language summary Are non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory medicines known as leukotriene receptor antagonists helpful and safe for eczema? Review question We wanted to see if anti‐inflammatory leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) reduced symptoms or improved quality of life in adults and children with established eczema; if they are safe; and whether they could be recommended as an effective alternative eczema treatment. We included studies that compared LTRAs with other treatments alone, such as topical corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory steroid (synthetic hormone) medications), or with placebo (an identical but inactive treatment). Background Eczema, also called 'atopic eczema' and 'dermatitis', is a common dry skin condition. Eczema can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on how itchy or red the skin is, how much skin is affected, and its impact on daily life. Eczema is sometimes linked to a group of conditions, including asthma. Corticosteroids are a commonly used treatment, but long‐term treatment can produce unwanted side effects, such as skin thinning. LTRAs have been shown to improve asthma symptoms, and their use in eczema would reduce the amount of steroids used. LTRAs are not currently given for eczema, and whether they are effective for this condition is uncertain. Study characteristics This evidence is current to September 2017. We found five studies with a total of 202 participants (both genders). All included participants had moderate‐to‐severe eczema diagnosed by a specialist doctor. Th studies lasted four to eight weeks. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. All studies used the LTRA montelukast, at a dose of either 5 mg or 10 mg. Only one study included children (31 participants, age 6 years and older). The age range for the other four studies was 16 to 70 years. LTRA treatment was compared with placebo or conventional treatment, which includes currently used eczema treatments, such as steroid creams. Varied scoring systems were used to calculate the effect of the treatments on participants' eczema. Two included studies were funded by the company that produces montelukast. Key results Limited available data meant we were unable to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of LTRA in eczema. Like other reviews on this topic, this review is unlikely to change how eczema is treated because there is no convincing evidence that montelukast, the only LTRA that could be assessed, is helpful for eczema. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast and placebo in terms of improving eczema disease severity (low‐quality evidence). When montelukast was compared with conventional treatment, participants using montelukast in one study saw an improvement in disease severity, but no difference was observed in another study. We are uncertain about these results because the quality of the evidence was very low. None of the studies looked at long‐term eczema control, moisturiser (emollients) use, or quality of life. We found no evidence that montelukast lessened itching or reduced the need for steroid creams during treatment when compared to placebo (low‐quality evidence). The studies comparing montelukast with conventional treatments did not assess these outcomes. Participants in four studies did not experience side effects. In one study comparing montelukast with placebo, there were two reported incidents in the montelukast group that resulted in participant withdrawal: one episode of septicaemia (blood poisoning) and one episode of dizziness. However, it was not clear whether these were related to the montelukast treatment. Other mild side effects were reported (e.g. headache, stomach‐related disturbances), but by participants in both groups. We therefore found no evidence of a difference between montelukast and placebo or conventional treatments, but this is assessment is based on low‐quality evidence. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence was low for all but one key result, that is montelukast’s effect on ‘change (improvement) in disease severity’ when compared with conventional treatment, the evidence for which was considered to be very low quality. Overall, very few studies addressed our review question. Many outcomes were not assessed, including long‐term control, and those that were assessed had relatively few participants, which were mainly adults. The studies focused solely on moderate‐severe eczema, and there were concerns with the participants or investigators knowing which treatment was received.	10.1002/14651858.CD011224.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	518	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011224.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

E.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	Anorexia Nervosa [*therapy]  Family Therapy [*methods]  Humans  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic  Treatment Outcome	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by a failure to maintain a normal body weight due to a paucity of nutrition, an intense fear of gaining weight or behaviour that prevents the individual from gaining weight, or both. The long‐term prognosis is often poor, with severe developmental, medical and psychosocial complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. 'Family therapy approaches' indicate a range of approaches, derived from different theories, that involve the family in treatment. We have included therapies developed on the basis of dominant family systems theories, approaches that are based on or broadly similar to the family‐based therapy derived from the Maudsley model, approaches that incorporate a focus on cognitive restructuring, as well as approaches that involve the family without articulation of a theoretical approach.This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of family therapy approaches compared with standard treatment and other treatments for AN. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) and PsycINFO (OVID) (all years to April 2016). We ran additional searches directly on Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 2008 and 2016 to 2018). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, together with four theses databases (all years to 2018). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have included in the analyses only studies from searches conducted to April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of family therapy approaches compared to any other intervention or other types of family therapy approaches were eligible for inclusion. We included participants of any age or gender with a primary clinical diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. Data collection and analysis Four review authors selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random‐effects meta‐analysis. We used the risk ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures. Main results We included 25 trials in this version of the review (13 from the original 2010 review and 12 newly‐included studies). Sixteen trials were of adolescents, eight trials of adults (seven of these in young adults aged up to 26 years) and one trial included three age groups: one adolescent, one young adult and one adult. Most investigated family‐based therapy or variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate, so that in a large number of studies we rated the risk of bias as unclear for many of the domains. Selective reporting bias was particularly problematic, with 68% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area, followed by incomplete outcome data, with 44% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area. For the main outcome measure of remission there was some low‐quality evidence (from only two studies, 81 participants) suggesting that family therapy approaches might offer some advantage over treatment as usual on rates of remission, post intervention (risk ratio (RR) 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 8.23; I 2 = 0%). However, at follow‐up, low‐quality evidence from only one study suggested this effect was not maintained. There was very low‐quality evidence from only one trial, which means it is difficult to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational interventions for remission (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.53 to 153.79; 1 study, N = 30). Similarly, there was very low‐quality evidence from only five trials for remission post‐intervention, again meaning that it is difficult to determine whether there is any advantage of family therapy approaches over psychological interventions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; participants = 252; studies = ; I 2 = 37%) and at long‐term follow‐up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28; participants = 200; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I 2 = 0%). There was no indication that the age group had any impact on the overall treatment effect; however, it should be noted that there were very few trials undertaken in adults, with the age range of adult studies included in this analysis from 20 to 27. There was some evidence of a small effect favouring family based therapy compared with other psychological interventions in terms of weight gain post‐intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; participants = 210; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I 2 = 11%) . Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether there were any differences between groups across all comparisons for most of the secondary outcomes (weight, eating disorder psychopathology, dropouts, relapse, or family functioning measures), either at post‐intervention or at follow‐up. Authors' conclusions There is a limited amount of low‐quality evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. This finding is based on two trials that included only a small number of participants, and both had issues about potential bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an advantage of family therapy approaches in people of any age compared to educational interventions (one study, very low quality) or psychological therapies (five studies, very low quality). Most studies contributing to this finding were undertaken in adolescents and youth. There are clear potential impacts on how family therapy approaches might be delivered to different age groups and further work is required to understand what the resulting effects on treatment efficacy might be. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one type of family therapy approach is more effective than another. The field would benefit from further large, well‐conducted trials. Plain language summary Family therapy for those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa Review Question This review investigated whether family therapy approaches reduce rates of anorexia nervosa (AN), or associated symptoms, compared to other treatments. Background People with AN have a deliberately maintained low body weight and distorted body image. They also experience related medical and psychological problems, and the risk of dying from the disease (mortality) is relatively high. Family therapy approaches are one form of treatment used in AN. Search date The evidence is current up to 8 April 2016. Study characteristics We included 25 trials in the review. Fourteen trials used family‐based therapy, one used systems family therapy, one used structural family therapy and seven studies used therapy with family involvement but did not provide specific details about the theory behind the therapy or its procedures, termed other family therapy. Two studies included two family therapy arms each: one included family‐based therapy and systems family therapy arms, and one included systems family therapy and other family therapy arms. Four studies compared family therapy approaches to treatment as usual, six compared family therapy approaches to other psychological interventions and two compared family therapy to educational interventions. Twelve studies compared various forms of family therapy approaches to each other. Two studies included both a treatment as usual as well as other psychological intervention arms. Key results Overall there was some low‐quality evidence from only two trials to suggest that family therapy approaches may be better than treatment as usual in the short term. The size and very low quality of the evidence base and the consistency of the trial outcomes are insufficient at this time to draw conclusions about whether family therapy approaches offer any clear advantage over educ tional or psychological interventions. We found very few differences between treatment groups on measures of weight, eating disorder symptoms and family functioning, and these differences were generally not maintained at follow‐up. The reporting of death rates was not clear enough to assess whether death is reduced for those treated with family therapy approaches compared to other interventions. There was very little information about the effects of the interventions on general or family functioning. Quality of the evidence The way the trials were run was not adequately described in many studies and we found potential risks of bias in most of the studies. This limited the meaningful conclusions that we could draw from the studies. Authors' conclusions Overall, there is a very limited evidence base in this field. There is some low‐quality evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to be able to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational interventions, other types of psychological therapy, or whether one type of family therapy approach is more effective than another. Most of the studies contributing to the findings were undertaken in adolescents and young adults. There are clear implications about how family therapy approaches might be delivered to different age groups, and we need further research to understand what the resulting effects on treatment might be.	10.1002/14651858.CD004780.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	484	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004780.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Chronic pain, defined as pain that recurs or persists for more than three months, is common in childhood. Chronic pain can affect nearly every aspect of daily life and is associated with disability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Objectives The aim of this review was to update the published evidence on the efficacy of psychological treatments for chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents. The primary objective of this updated review was to determine any effect of psychological therapy on the clinical outcomes of pain intensity and disability for chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents compared with active treatment, waiting‐list, or treatment‐as‐usual care. The secondary objective was to examine the impact of psychological therapies on children's depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and determine adverse events. Search methods Searches were undertaken of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. We searched for further RCTs in the references of all identified studies, meta‐analyses, and reviews, and trial registry databases. The most recent search was conducted in May 2018. Selection criteria RCTs with at least 10 participants in each arm post‐treatment comparing psychological therapies with active treatment, treatment‐as‐usual, or waiting‐list control for children or adolescents with recurrent or chronic pain were eligible for inclusion. We excluded trials conducted remotely via the Internet. Data collection and analysis We analysed included studies and we assessed quality of outcomes. We combined all treatments into one class named 'psychological treatments'. We separated the trials by the number of participants that were included in each arm; trials with > 20 participants per arm versus trials with < 20 participants per arm. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed chronic pain conditions. We assessed the impact of both conditions on four outcomes: pain, disability, depression, and anxiety. We extracted data at two time points; post‐treatment (immediately or the earliest data available following end of treatment) and at follow‐up (between three and 12 months post‐treatment). Main results We identified 10 new studies (an additional 869 participants) in the updated search. The review thus included a total of 47 studies, with 2884 children and adolescents completing treatment (mean age 12.65 years, SD 2.21 years). Twenty‐three studies addressed treatments for headache (including migraine); 10 for abdominal pain; two studies treated participants with either a primary diagnosis of abdominal pain or irritable bowel syndrome, two studies treated adolescents with fibromyalgia, two studies included adolescents with temporomandibular disorders, three were for the treatment of pain associated with sickle cell disease, and two studies treated adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, three studies included adolescents with mixed pain conditions. Overall, we judged the included studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias. Children with headache pain We found that psychological therapies reduced pain frequency post‐treatment for children and adolescents with headaches (risk ratio (RR) 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 3.30, P < 0.01, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2.86), but these effects were not maintained at follow‐up. We did not find a beneficial effect of psychological therapies on reducing disability in young people post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.56 to 0.03), but we did find a beneficial effect in a small number of studies at follow‐up (SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.15). We found no beneficial effect of psychological interventions on depression or anxiety symptoms. Children with mixed pain conditions We found that psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post‐treatment for children a d adolescents with mixed pain conditions (SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.67 to ‐0.19, P < 0.01), but these effects were not maintained at follow‐up. We did find beneficial effects of psychological therapies on reducing disability for young people with mixed pain conditions post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.15) and at follow‐up (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.06). We found no beneficial effect of psychological interventions on depression symptoms. In contrast, we found a beneficial effect on anxiety at post‐treatment in children with mixed pain conditions (SMD ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.03), but this was not maintained at follow‐up. Across all pain conditions, we found that adverse events were reported in seven trials, of which two studies reported adverse events that were study‐related. Quality of evidence We found the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low, mostly downgraded for unexplained heterogeneity, limitations in study design, imprecise and sparse data, or suspicion of publication bias. This means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect, or we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; or the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Authors' conclusions Psychological treatments delivered predominantly face‐to‐face might be effective for reducing pain outcomes for children and adolescents with headache or other chronic pain conditions post‐treatment. However, there were no effects at follow‐up. Psychological therapies were also beneficial for reducing disability in children with mixed chronic pain conditions at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and for children with headache at follow‐up. We found no beneficial effect of therapies for improving depression or anxiety. The conclusions of this update replicate and add to those of a previous version of the review which found that psychological therapies were effective in reducing pain frequency/intensity for children with headache and mixed chronic pain conditions post‐treatment. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents Bottom line Psychological therapies reduce pain frequency immediately following treatment for children and adolescents with chronic headache and reduce pain intensity for children and adolescents with mixed chronic pain conditions. Psychological therapies also reduce disability for children and adolescents with mixed chronic pain conditions immediately following treatment and up to 12 months later, and for children with headache conditions up to 12 months later. Background Chronic pain or pain that lasts for longer than three months is common in young people. Psychological therapies (e.g. relaxation, hypnosis, coping skills training, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioural therapy) may help people manage pain and its disabling consequences. Therapies can be delivered face‐to‐face by a therapist, via the Internet, by telephone call, or by computer programme. This review focused on treatments that are delivered face‐to‐face by a therapist, which includes therapies delivered by telephone or via a book with exercise instructions. For children and adolescents, there is evidence that relaxation by itself and cognitive behavioural therapy (treatment that helps people test and revise their thoughts and actions) are effective in reducing the intensity of pain in chronic headache, recurrent abdominal pain, fibromyalgia, and sickle cell disease immediately after treatment. Study Characteristics This review included 47 studies with 2884 participants. The average age of the children and adolescents was 12.6 years. Most studies included young people with headache (23 studies) or stomach pain (10 studies), The remaining studies investigated children with irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or inc uded samples with various chronic pain conditions. Key results Psychological therapies reduced pain frequency immediately following treatment for children and adolescents with chronic headache, and pain intensity and anxiety for children and adolescents with other chronic pain conditions. Psychological therapies also reduced disability for children and adolescents with non‐headache chronic pain conditions immediately following treatment and for children with headache and mixed chronic pain conditions up to 12 months later. We did not find any benefit of psychological treatments on reducing anxiety for children with headache or for depression in children with headache or mixed chronic pain conditions. Quality of evidence We judged all outcomes to be low or very low‐quality, meaning our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect or we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; or the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.	10.1002/14651858.CD003968.pub5	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	500	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003968.pub5	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Gene therapy for peripheral arterial disease	Forster RL, A.  Bhattacharya, V.  Shaw, J.  Stansby, G.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), caused by narrowing of the arteries in the limbs, is increasing in incidence and prevalence as our population is ageing and as diabetes is becoming more prevalent. PAD can cause pain in the limbs while walking, known as intermittent claudication, or can be more severe and cause pain while at rest, ulceration, and ultimately gangrene and limb loss. This more severe stage of PAD is known as 'critical limb ischaemia'. Treatments for PAD include medications that help to reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular events and help improve blood flow, as well as endovascular or surgical repair or bypass of the blocked arteries. However, many people are unresponsive to medications and are not suited to surgical or endovascular treatment, leaving amputation as the last option. Gene therapy is a novel approach in which genetic material encoding for proteins that may help increase revascularisation is injected into the affected limbs of patients. This type of treatment has been shown to be safe, but its efficacy, especially regarding ulcer healing, effects on quality of life, and other symptomatic outcomes remain unknown. Objectives To assess the effects of gene therapy for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched Cochrane CENTRAL, the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED, along with trials registries (all searched 27 November 2017). We also checked reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews for further studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised studies that evaluated gene therapy versus no gene therapy in people with PAD. We excluded studies that evaluated direct growth hormone treatment or cell‐based treatments. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, performed quality assessment, and extracted data from the included studies. We collected pertinent information on each study, as well as data for the outcomes of amputation‐free survival, ulcer healing, quality of life, amputation, all‐cause mortality, ankle brachial index, symptom scores, and claudication distance. Main results We included in this review a total of 17 studies with 1988 participants (evidence current until November 2017). Three studies limited their inclusion to people with intermittent claudication, 12 limited inclusion to people with varying levels of critical limb ischaemia, and two included people with either condition. Study investigators evaluated many different types of gene therapies, using different protocols. Most studies evaluated growth factor‐encoding gene therapy, with six studies using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‐encoding genes, four using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)‐encoding genes, and three using fibroblast growth factor (FGF)‐encoded genes. Two studies evaluated hypoxia‐inducible factor 1‐alpha (HIF‐1α) gene therapy, one study used a developmental endothelial locus‐1 gene therapy, and the final study evaluated a stromal cell‐derived factor‐1 (SDF‐1) gene therapy. Most studies reported outcomes after 12 months of follow‐up, but follow‐up ranged from three months to two years. Overall risk of bias varied between studies, with many studies not providing sufficient detail for adequate determination of low risk of bias for many domains. Two studies did not utilise a placebo control, leading to risk of performance bias. Several studies reported in previous protocols or in their Methods sections that they would report on certain outcomes for which no data were then reported, increasing risk of reporting bias. All included studies reported sponsorships from corporate entities that led to unclear risk of other bias. The overall quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, generally as the result of heterogeneity and imprecision, with few or no studies reporting on outcomes. Evidence suggests no clear differences for the outcomes of amput tion‐free survival, major amputation, and all‐cause mortality between those treated with gene therapy and those not receiving this treatment (all moderate‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence suggests improvement in complete ulcer healing with gene therapy (odds ratio (OR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 4.59; P = 0.04). We could not combine data on quality of life and can draw no conclusions at this time regarding this outcome (very low‐quality evidence). We included one study in the meta‐analysis for ankle brachial index, which showed no clear differences between treatments, but we can draw no overall association (low‐quality evidence). We combined in a meta‐analysis pain symptom scores as assessed by visual analogue scales from two studies and found no clear differences between treatment groups (very low‐quality evidence). We carried out extensive subgroup analyses by PAD classification, dosage schedule, vector type, and gene used but identified no substantial differences. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence shows no clear differences in amputation‐free survival, major amputation, and all‐cause mortality between those treated with gene therapy and those not receiving gene therapy. Some evidence suggests that gene therapy may lead to improved complete ulcer healing, but this outcome needs to be explored with improved reporting of the measure, such as decreased ulcer area in cm², and better description of ulcer types and healing. Further standardised data that are amenable to meta‐analysis are needed to evaluate other outcomes such as quality of life, ankle brachial index, symptom scores, and claudication distance. Plain language summary Gene therapy for peripheral arterial disease Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) occurs when the blood flow to the limbs is restricted because of narrowed arteries. This circulatory problem is increasing in the population because of increased levels of diabetes and because the population is ageing. Due to restricted blood flow, PAD can cause pain in the legs while walking, usually after some distance (known as 'intermittent claudication'). As the disease becomes more severe, a person can experience serious pain while at rest, as well as ulcers in the feet and legs (known as 'critical limb ischaemia'). PAD can be treated with medication or through interventions such as surgical or endovascular procedures (less invasive than surgery, endovascular intervention is carried out through a small incision to access the vessels). However, many people will not respond to medication, and surgical or endovascular procedures may not be appropriate because of medical risks. In these cases, for extreme PAD, the only option for treating the condition is amputation. Therapies are needed that can help repair the vessels in the limbs of people with PAD to restore adequate blood flow. Gene therapy is a novel approach whereby genetic material, encoded for proteins that may help to improve blood flow by restoring blood vessels, is injected into a person's legs. Trials have shown that this treatment is safe, but whether it is effective in reducing the risk of amputation or improving quality of life remains unknown. Review question Is there a difference in outcomes of effectiveness (such as amputation, death, ulcer healing, and quality of life) between patients with symptomatic PAD who are given gene therapy and those who are not given gene therapy? Study characteristics We included 17 studies that had a total of 1988 participants (evidence current until November 2017). These studies used various types of gene therapy as well as different dosages, some providing single treatments and some repeated treatments. Most of the studies included people with critical limb ischaemia; three studies included people with intermittent claudication. Key results When combining the data, we found no clear differences between people who received gene therapy and those who did not in terms of amputation‐free survival (patients who did not have an amputation and did no die), major amputation (above the ankle), or death. We did see improvement in complete ulcer healing in the gene therapy treatment group compared to the control group. Studies show no clear differences in pain symptom scores, but we evaluated only two studies for this outcome. Not enough data are available to show if there was a difference between groups for the measure of blood flow known as the 'ankle brachial index'. We were not able to combine data on quality of life or pain‐free walking distances (distances one can walk without experiencing leg pain). Quality of the evidence Risk of bias of the included studies varied greatly, and this was a concern because studies did not clearly report on their methods nor on follow‐up of participants. Most studies used a placebo control, which increases the risk that outcomes may have been different if people knew they were given treatment or control. Corporations that produce the tested treatments sponsored all included trials. The quality of evidence varied from moderate to very low. For amputation‐free survival, major amputation, and death, we considered the quality of evidence to be moderate because of differences between studies. For ulcer healing, risk of bias was a matter of concern, and study results were imprecise because few events were reported. The quality of evidence for quality of life was very low because of differences between studies and insufficient information to combine study findings. The quality of evidence for the ankle brachial index was low because only one study with few participants reported this outcome. For pain symptom scores, the quality of evidence was very low because of technical problems within one of the two studies, as well as differences between the two studies and few participants.	10.1002/14651858.CD012058.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	509	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012058.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Surgery for endometrial cancer (hysterectomy with removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries) is performed through laparotomy. It has been suggested that the laparoscopic approach is associated with a reduction in operative morbidity. Over the last two decades there has been a steady increase of the use of laparoscopy for endometrial cancer. This review investigated the evidence of benefits and harms of laparoscopic surgery compared with laparotomy for presumed early stage endometrial cancer. Objectives To compare overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for laparoscopic surgery versus laparotomy in women with presumed early stage endometrial cancer. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid (April 2012 to June 2018) and Embase via Ovid (April 2012 to June 2018). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. The trial registers included NHMRC Clinical Trials Register, UKCCCR Register of Cancer Trials, Meta‐Register and Physician Data Query Protocol. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laparoscopy and laparotomy for early stage endometrial cancer. Data collection and analysis We independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used hazard ratios (HRs) for OS and recurrence free survival (RFS), risk ratios (RR) for severe adverse events and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes in women who received laparoscopy or laparotomy with 9% confidence intervals (CI). These were pooled in random‐effects meta‐analyses. Main results We identified one new study in this update of the review. The review contains nine RCTs comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy for the surgical management of early stage endometrial cancer. All nine studies met the inclusion criteria and assessed 4389 women at the end of the studies. Six studies assessing 3993 participants with early stage endometrial cancer found no significant difference in the risk of death between women who underwent laparoscopy and women who underwent laparotomy (HR 1.04, 95% 0.86 to 1.25; moderate‐certainty evidence) and five studies assessing 3710 participants found no significant difference in the risk of recurrence between the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.43; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no significant difference in the rate of perioperative death; women requiring a blood transfusion; and bladder, ureteric, bowel and vascular injury. However, one meta‐analysis of three studies found that women in the laparoscopy group lost significantly less blood than women in the laparotomy group (MD –106.82 mL, 95% CI –141.59 to –72.06; low‐certainty evidence). A further meta‐analysis of two studies, which assessed 3344 women and included one very large trial of over 2500 participants, found that there was no clinical difference in the risk of severe postoperative complications in women in the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.38). Most studies were at moderate risk of bias. All nine studies reported hospital stay and results showed that on average, laparoscopy was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay. Authors' conclusions This review found low to moderate‐certainty evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer. For presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar OS and DFS. Furthermore, laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. There is no significant difference in severe postoperative morbidity between the two modalities. The certainty of evidence for OS and RFS was moderate and was downgraded for unclear risk of bias profiles and imprecision in effect estimates. However, most studi s used adequate methods of sequence generation and concealment of allocation so studies were not prone to selection bias. Adverse event outcomes were downgraded for the same reasons and additionally for low event rates and low power thus these outcomes provided low‐certainty evidence. Plain language summary Laparoscopy versus laparotomy for the management of presumed early stage endometrial cancer Background   Worldwide, cancer of the womb or 'endometrial cancer' is the fifth most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and has a higher incidence in high income countries than in low and middle income countries. For women with cancer of the womb, removal of the womb (hysterectomy) and removal of both fallopian tubes (tubes along which eggs travel from the ovaries to the womb) and ovaries (which produce eggs) is considered current standard treatment. Other treatments include radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Traditionally, surgery for cancer of the womb is performed through a laparotomy (open cut in the abdomen). Review question   This review compared overall survival (length of time that the woman remained alive) and disease free survival (length of time that the women remained disease‐free) for laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery with laparotomy in women with presumed early endometrial cancer. Key results   Results from six trials where women were randomly put into one of two treatment groups showed no difference in the risk of death between women who had laparoscopy and women who had laparotomy. In addition, results from five randomised trials confirmed no difference in the risk of cancer recurrence between women who had laparoscopy and women who had laparotomy. Notably, laparoscopy was associated with less blood loss and earlier discharge from hospital. Certainty of the evidence   The certainty of the evidence for overall and recurrence free survival was moderate. Certainty for side effects was low. What were the conclusions?   This review update confirms the findings of the previous review that laparoscopy (keyhole) is an effective and viable alternative to laparotomy (open surgery) in the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer. With regards to long term survival outcomes, treatment by laparoscopy is comparable to laparotomy.	10.1002/14651858.CD006655.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	497	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006655.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Active mind‐body movement therapies as an adjunct to or in comparison with pulmonary rehabilitation for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	Gendron LMN, A.  Saey, D.  Maltais, F.  Lacasse, Y.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Active mindâ€body movement therapies (AMBMTs), including but not limited to yoga, tai chi, and qigong, have been applied as exercise modalities for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). AMBMT strategies have been found to be more effective than usual care; however, whether AMBMT is inferior, equivalent, or superior to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in people with COPD remains to be determined. Objectives To assess the effects of AMBMTs compared with, or in addition to, PR in the management of COPD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and major Chinese databases, as well as trial registries from inception to July 2017. In addition, we searched references of primary studies and review articles. We updated this search in July 2018 but have not yet incorporated these results. Selection criteria We included (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing AMBMT (i.e. controlled breathing and/or focused meditation/attention interventions for which patients must actively move their joints and muscles for at least four weeks with no minimum intervention frequency) versus PR (any inpatient or outpatient, communityâ€based or homeâ€based rehabilitation programme lasting at least four weeks, with no minimum intervention frequency, that included conventional exercise training with or without education or psychological support) and (2) RCTs comparing AMBMT + PR versus PR alone in people with COPD. Two independent review authors screened and selected studies for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors if necessary to ask them to provide missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a randomâ€effects model. Main results We included in the metaâ€analysis 10 studies with 762 participants across one or more comparisons. The sample size of included studies ranged from 11 to 206 participants. Nine out of 10 studies involving all levels of COPD severity were conducted in China with adults from 55 to 88 years of age, a higher proportion of whom were male (78%). Nine out of 10 studies provided tai chi and/or qigong programmes as AMBMT, and one study provided yoga. Overall, the term 'PR' has been uncritically applied in the vast majority of studies, which limits comparison of AMBMT and PR. For example, eight out of 10 studies considered walking training as equal to PR and used this as conventional exercise training within PR. Overall study quality for main comparisons was moderate to very low mainly owing to imprecision, indirectness (exercise component inconsistent with recommendations), and risk of bias issues. The primary outcomes for our review were quality of life, dyspnoea, and serious adverse events. When researchers compared AMBMT versus PR alone (mainly unstructured walking training), statistically significant improvements in diseaseâ€specific quality of life (QoL) (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score) favoured AMBMT: mean difference (MD) â€5.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) â€8.75 to â€2.92; three trials; 249 participants; lowâ€quality evidence. The common effect size, but not the 95% CI around the pooled treatment effect, exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of minus four. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) also revealed statistically significant improvements favouring AMBMT over PR, with scores exceeding the MCID of three, with an MD of 6.58 units (95% CI â€9.16 to â€“ 4.00 units; one trial; 74 participants; lowâ€quality evidence). Results show no betweenâ€group differences with regard to dyspnoea measured by the modified Medical Research Council Scale (MD 0.00 units, 95% CI â€0.37 to 0.37; two trials; 127 participants; lowâ€quality evidence), the Borg Scale (MD 0.44 units, 95% CI â€0.88 to 0.00; one trial; 139 participants; lowâ€quality evidence), or the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnoea Scale (MD â€0.21, 95% CI â 2.81 to 2.38; one trial; 11 participants; lowâ€quality evidence). Comparisons of AMBMT versus PR alone did not include assessments of generic quality of life, adverse events, limb muscle function, exacerbations, or adherence. Comparisons of AMBMT added to PR versus PR alone (mainly unstructured walking training) revealed significant improvements in generic QoL as measured by Short Form (SF)â€36 for both the SFâ€36 general health summary score (MD 5.42, 95% CI 3.82 to 7.02; one trial; 80 participants; very lowâ€quality evidence) and the SFâ€36 mental health summary score (MD 3.29, 95% CI 1.45 to 4.95; one trial; 80 participants; very lowâ€quality evidence). With regard to diseaseâ€specific QoL, investigators noted no significant improvement with addition of AMBMT to PR versus PR alone (SGRQ total score: MD â€2.57, 95% CI â€7.76 to 2.62 units; one trial; 192 participants; moderateâ€quality evidence; CRQ Dyspnoea Scale score: MD 0.04, 95% CI â€2.18 to 2.26 units; one trial; 80 participants; very lowâ€quality evidence). Comparisons of AMBMT + PR versus PR alone did not include assessments of dyspnoea, adverse events, limb muscle function, exacerbations, or adherence. Authors' conclusions Given the quality of available evidence, the effects of AMBMT versus PR or of AMBMT added to PR versus PR alone in people with stable COPD remain inconclusive. Evidence of low quality suggests better diseaseâ€specific QoL with AMBMT versus PR in people with stable COPD, and evidence of very low quality suggests no differences in dyspnoea between AMBMT and PR. Evidence of moderate quality shows that AMBMT added to PR does not result in improved diseaseâ€specific QoL, and evidence of very low quality suggests that AMBMT added to PR may lead to better generic QoL versus PR alone. Future studies with adequate descriptions of conventional exercise training (i.e. information on duration, intensity, and progression) delivered by trained professionals with a comprehensive understanding of respiratory physiology, exercise science, and the pathology of COPD are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding treatment outcomes with AMBMT versus PR or AMBMT added to PR versus PR alone for patients with COPD. Plain language summary Active mindâ€body movement therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of ill health and is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. COPD describes a chronic lung condition in which shortness of breath, tiredness, and exercise intolerance are typical symptoms. Active mindâ€body movement therapies (AMBMTs) consist of mindâ€body therapies such as controlled breathing and/or focused meditation/attention interventions whereby participants must actively move their joints and muscles (e.g. yoga, tai chi, qigong). Although different forms of AMBMT may differ in origin, they usually share similar principles: movement/posture, controlled breathing, and focused attention/meditation. AMBMT strategies applied to people with COPD have been found to be more effective than usual care. However the effect of AMBMT as an adjunct to or in direct comparison with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), the cornerstone of COPD management, remains to be determined; this is the objective of the current review. Study characteristics We included 10 studies involving 762 participants who were randomly assigned to receive AMBMT alone or in combination with PR or PR alone (mainly unstructured walking training). The quality of included studies was generally poor. Key results Given the quality of available evidence, effects of AMBMT in comparison with PR or of AMBMT added to PR in comparison with PR alone remain inconclusive. One key reason for this is that PR programmes used as comparators had major design flaws, for example, the term 'PR' was uncritically used in the vast majority of studies, and PR was often considered equal to unstructured walking training. This, together with the poor quality of evidence, limits our confidence in the obs rved effects. Available evidence suggests that when AMBMT was compared to PR alone, larger improvements in diseaseâ€specific quality of life were observed with AMBMT, although AMBMT was not superior to PR with regard to dyspnoea (breathlessness). AMBMT added to PR resulted in large improvement in generic quality of life when compared with PR alone, although the addition of AMBMT to PR did not lead to further improvements in diseaseâ€specific quality of life. However, before definitive conclusions can be drawn, future research studies comparing AMBMT to PR are needed, and these should follow current PR guidelines for designing comparator interventions, preferably delivered by properly trained professionals with a comprehensive understanding of respiratory physiology, exercise science, and the pathology of COPD.	10.1002/14651858.CD012290.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	487	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012290.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Dietary modifications for infantile colic	Gordon MB, E.  Sorrenti, M.  Lingua, C.  Moja, L.  Banks, S. S. C.  Ceratto, S.  Savino, F.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Infantile colic is typically defined as full‐force crying for at least three hours per day, on at least three days per week, for at least three weeks. This condition appears to be more frequent in the first six weeks of life (prevalence range of 17% to 25%), depending on the specific location reported and definitions used, and it usually resolves by three months of age. The aetiopathogenesis of infantile colic is unclear but most likely multifactorial. A number of psychological, behavioural and biological components (food hypersensitivity, allergy or both; gut microflora and dysmotility) are thought to contribute to its manifestation. The role of diet as a component in infantile colic remains controversial. Objectives To assess the effects of dietary modifications for reducing colic in infants less than four months of age. Search methods In July 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase , 17 other databases and 2 trials registers. We also searched Google, checked and handsearched references and contacted study authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating the effects of dietary modifications, alone or in combination, for colicky infants younger than four months of age versus another intervention or placebo. We used specific definitions for colic, age of onset and the methods for performing the intervention. We defined 'modified diet' as any diet altered to include or exclude certain components. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was duration of crying, and secondary outcomes were response to intervention, frequency of crying episodes, parental/family quality of life, infant sleep duration, parental satisfaction and adverse effects. Main results We included 15 RCTs involving 1121 infants (balanced numbers of boys and girls) aged 2 to 16 weeks. All studies were small and at high risk of bias across multiple design factors (e.g. selection, attrition). The studies covered a wide range of dietary interventions, and there was limited scope for meta‐analysis. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Low‐allergen maternal diet versus a diet containing known potential allergens : one study (90 infants) found that 35/47 (74%) of infants responded to a low‐allergen maternal diet, compared with 16/43 (37%) of infants on a diet containing known potential allergens. Low‐allergen diet or soy milk formula versus dicyclomine hydrochloride : one study (120 infants) found that 10/15 (66.6%) breastfed babies responded to dicyclomine hydrochloride, compared with 24/45 (53.3%) formula‐fed babies. There was little difference in response between breastfed babies whose mother changed their diet (10/16; 62.5%) and babies who received soy milk formula (29/44; 65.9%). Hydrolysed formula versus standard formula : two studies (64 infants) found no difference in duration of crying, reported as a dichotomous outcome: risk ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 5.10; very low‐quality evidence. The author of one study confirmed there were no adverse effects. One study (43 infants) reported a greater reduction in crying time postintervention with hydrolysed formula (104 min/d, 95% CI 55 to 155) than with standard formula (3 min/d, 95% CI −63 to 67). Hydrolysed formula versus another hydrolysed formula : one study (22 infants) found that two types of hydrolysed formula were equally effective in resolving symptoms for babies who commenced with standard formula (Alimentum reduced crying to 2.21 h/d (standard deviation (SD) 0.40) and Nutramigen to 2.93 h/d (SD 0.70)). Hydrolysed formula or dairy‐ and soy‐free maternal diet versus addition of parental education or counselling : one study (21 infants) found that crying time decreased to 2.03 h/d (SD 1.03) in the hydrolysed or dairy‐ and soy‐free group compared with 1.08 h/d (SD 0.7) in the parent education or counselling group, nine days into the intervention. Partially hydrolysed, lower l ctose, whey‐based formulae containing oligosaccharide versus standard formula with simethicone : one study (267 infants) found that both groups experienced a decrease in colic episodes (secondary outcome) after seven days (partially hydrolysed formula: from 5.99 episodes (SD 1.84) to 2.47 episodes (SD 1.94); standard formula: from 5.41 episodes (SD 1.88) to 3.72 episodes (SD 1.98)). After two weeks the difference between the two groups was significant (partially hydrolysed: 1.76 episodes (SD 1.60); standard formula: 3.32 episodes (SD 2.06)). The study author confirmed there were no adverse effects. Lactase enzyme supplementation versus placebo : three studies (138 infants) assessed this comparison, but none reported data amenable to analysis for any outcome. There were no adverse effects in any of the studies. Extract of Foeniculum vulgare, Matricariae recutita , and Melissa officinalis versus placebo : one study (93 infants) found that average daily crying time was lower for infants given the extract (76.9 min/d (SD 23.5), than infants given placebo (169.9 min/d (SD 23.1), at the end of the one‐week study. There were no adverse effects. Soy protein‐based formula versus standard cows' milk protein‐based formula : one study (19 infants) reported a mean crying time of 12.7 h/week (SD 16.4) in the soy formula group versus 17.3 h/week (SD 6.9) in the standard cows' milk group, and that 5/10 (50%) responded in the soy formula group versus 0/9 (0%) in the standard cows' milk group. Soy protein formula with polysaccharide versus standard soy protein formula : one study (27 infants) assessed this comparison but did not provide disaggregated data for the number of responders in each group after treatment. No study reported on our secondary outcomes of parental or family quality of life, infant sleep duration per 24 h, or parental satisfaction. Authors' conclusions Currently, evidence of the effectiveness of dietary modifications for the treatment of infantile colic is sparse and at significant risk of bias. The few available studies had small sample sizes, and most had serious limitations. There were insufficient studies, thus limiting the use of meta‐analysis. Benefits reported for hydrolysed formulas were inconsistent. Based on available evidence, we are unable to recommend any intervention. Future studies of single interventions, using clinically significant outcome measures, and appropriate design and power are needed. Plain language summary Diet changes for infant colic Review question Do colicky infants show an improvement when breastfeeding mothers follow a low‐allergen diet, or when formula‐fed infants are fed a special formula? Background Infantile colic is a common problem afflicting otherwise healthy infants in the first three months of life. It is characterised by episodes of inconsolable crying lasting for longer than three hours per day, for more than three days a week, for at least three weeks. It can be very distressing for parents. Dietary changes, such as removing cows' milk from a breastfeeding mother's diet or switching formula‐fed babies to a special soy‐based formula, might reduce the symptoms of colic. Study characteristics We found 15 randomised controlled trials, a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups, involving a total of 1121 babies with colic. The evidence is current to July 2018. Infants (balanced between boys and girls) were less than three months of age. Key results Most studies reported data on a combination of outcomes: duration of crying, number of responders in each group after treatment (i.e. those who experienced a decrease in daily crying), or frequency of crying episodes. No study reported on parental or family quality of life, infant sleep or parental satisfaction. Six studies reported that there were no side effects as a result of the dietary changes. Low‐allergen diet One study (90 infants) found that more breastfed infants responded to a low‐allergen maternal diet than infants on a standard diet containi g known potential allergens. One study (120 infants) found little difference in breastfed infants whose mothers were given a low‐allergen diet (10/16, 62.5%) and formula‐fed babies who were given soy milk (29/44, 65.9%), but the researchers did find that breastfed babies responded more to dicyclomine hydrochloride (a tablet for treating stomach spasms) than formula‐fed babies. Hydrolysed formula milk Two studies (64 infants) found no difference in duration of crying between the hydrolysed (hypoallergenic) and standard cow's milk groups. Of these, one study (43 infants) reported a greater reduction in crying time at study end in infants who were given hydrolysed milk. A third study (22 infants) found that two types of hydrolysed formulas were equally effective in resolving symptoms of colic for babies started on standard formula. A fourth study (21 infants) reported that infants whose parents were given information and support experienced a more rapid reduction in crying time than infants who were given a hydrolysed formula or dairy‐ and soy‐free diet (within nine days). A fifth study (267 infants) found that both partially hydrolysed formula with oligosaccharides (carbohydrates) and a standard formula with simethicone (a drug for treating symptoms of gas) reduced colic episodes after seven days, but effects were greater in the hydrolysed plus oligosaccharides group after two weeks. Lactase enzyme supplementation Three studies (138 infants) tested the effect of adding lactase (an enzyme which helps break down the lactose (sugar) in milk) to the infants' milk. The results were not presented in a form to allow analysis. Fennel, chamomile and lemon balm extract One study (93 infants) found that average daily crying time in breastfed babies reduced within one week of treatment with a fennel, chamomile and lemon balm extract. Soy protein‐based formula One study (19 infants) found that, compared with cows' milk formula, soy formula reduced crying time and increased the number of responders. However, international guidance does not support the use of soy milk due to concerns that they can impact hormones in babies, so these results are not relevant. One study (27 infants) compared soy formula plus polysaccharide (carbohydrate) with soy formula alone but did not present results in a form we could analyse. Quality of the evidence Many of the studies included only small numbers of participants and were of poor quality. We did not find evidence of effectiveness for most dietary interventions. Where studies did report some benefit, this was not large enough to be meaningful. Conclusions Based on the available evidence, we are not able to recommend any of the dietary modifications assessed in this review.	10.1002/14651858.CD011029.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	534	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011029.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Vasodilators have been proposed to increase endometrial receptivity, thicken the endometrium, and favour uterine relaxation, all of which could improve uterine receptivity and enhance the chances for successful assisted pregnancy. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vasodilators in women undergoing fertility treatment. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases, trial registers, and websites: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of of Controlled Trials, via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Knowledge, the Open System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted the search in October 2017 and applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vasodilators alone or in combination with other treatments versus placebo or no treatment or versus other agents in women undergoing fertility treatment. Data collection and analysis Four review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and calculated risk ratios (RRs). We combined study data using a fixed‐effect model and assessed evidence quality using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methods. Our primary outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy and vasodilator side effects. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, endometrial thickness, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy. Main results We included 15 studies with a total of 1326 women. All included studies compared a vasodilator versus placebo or no treatment. We judged most of these studies as having unclear risk of bias. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes. The main limitations were imprecision due to low numbers of events and participants and risk of bias due to unclear methods of randomisation. Vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of live birth compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.69; three RCTs; N = 350; I² = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence) but probably increase overall rates of side effects including headache and tachycardia (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.66; four RCTs; N = 418; I² = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). Evidence suggests that if 236 per 1000 women achieve live birth with placebo or no treatment, then between 196 and 398 per 1000 will do so with the use of vasodilators. Compared with placebo or no treatment, vasodilators may slightly improve clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.77; 11 RCTs; N = 1054; I² = 6%; low‐quality evidence). Vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of multiple gestation (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.42; three RCTs; N = 370; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence), miscarriage (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.86; three RCTs; N = 350; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence), or ectopic pregnancy (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.69; two RCTs; N = 250; I² = 5%; low‐quality evidence). All studies found benefit for endometrial thickening, but reported effects varied (I² = 92%) and ranged from a mean difference of 0.80 higher (95% CI 0.18 to 1.42) to 3.57 higher (95% CI 3.01 to 4.13) with very low‐quality evidence, so we are uncertain how to interpret these results. Authors' conclusions Evidence was insufficient to show whether vasodilators increase the live birth rate in women undergoing fertility treatment. However, low‐quality evidence suggests that vasodilators may slightly increase clinical pregnancy rate . Moderate‐quality evidence shows that vasodilators increase overall side effects in comparison with placebo or no treatment. Adequately powered studies are needed so that each treatment can be evaluated more accurately. Plain language summary Vasodilators for women undergoing fertility treatment Review question Researchers at Cochrane reviewed available evidence on the effects of vasodilators (drugs used to widen blood vessels) in women undergoing fertility treatment. Background For women undergoing fertility treatment for different causes, interventions aimed at improving the receptivity of the uterus are of utmost importance. Many different drugs have been evaluated, with the aim of increasing rates of implantation and live birth. These include vasodilating agents, which are used to dilate blood vessels to improve endometrial receptivity, thicken the endometrium, and favour uterine relaxation, among other effects. Study characteristics We found 15 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which people are randomly allocated to one or more treatment groups) that compared the use of vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment in a total of 1326 women undergoing fertility treatment. The evidence is current to October 2017. Key results Only three of the included studies reported live birth rates. Overall, vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of live birth. Moderate‐quality evidence shows that vasodilators probably increase overall rates of side effects (including headache and tachycardia (faster than normal heartbeat)) in comparison with placebo or no treatment. However, low‐quality evidence suggests that vasodilators may increase the chance of becoming pregnant. Quality of the evidence The evidence is of low to moderate quality. More research is needed (one study is ongoing and will be incorporated into this review in a subsequent update).	10.1002/14651858.CD010001.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	475	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010001.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

S.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	Abortion, Habitual [prevention & control]  Abortion, Spontaneous [*prevention & control]  Female  Humans  Pregnancy  Pregnancy Trimester, Second  Progestins [*therapeutic use]  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review, last published in 2013. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (6 July 2017) and reference lists from relevant articles, attempting to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Thirteen trials (2556 women) met the inclusion criteria. Nine of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single‐center trials, conducted in Egypt, India, Jordan, UK and USA. In six trials women had had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in seven trials women had suffered two or more consecutive miscarriages. Routes, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eleven trials (2359 women) contributed data to the analyses. The meta‐analysis of all women, suggests that there is probably a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo/controls (average risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.92, 11 trials, 2359 women, moderate‐quality evidence). A subgroup analysis comparing placebo‐controlled versus non‐placebo‐controlled trials and different routes of administration showed no differences between subgroups for miscarriage. However, there appears to be a subgroup difference for miscarriage between women with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, with a more pronounced effect in women with three or more prior miscarriages. However, it should be noted that there was high heterogeneity in the subgroup of women with three or more prior miscarriages. None of the trials reported on any secondary maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility. There was probably a slight benefit for women receiving progestogen seen in the outcome of live birth rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.24, 7 trials, 2086 women, moderate‐quality evidence). While the rate of preterm birth is probably reduced for women receiving progestogen, this outcome was mainly driven by one trial and thus should be interpreted with great caution (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89, 5 trials, 811 women, moderate‐quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other secondary outcomes of neonatal death or fetal genital abnormalities. A possible reduction in stillbirth was seen, but again this outcome was driven mainly by one trial and should be interpreted with caution (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58, 3 trials, 1199 women). There may be little or no difference in the rate of low birthweight and trials did not report on the secondary child outcomes of teratoge ic effects or admission to a special care unit. Authors' conclusions For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, supplementation with progestogen therapy probably reduces the rate of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies. Plain language summary Progestogen for preventing miscarriage What is the issue? Early pregnancy loss, also known as miscarriage, generally occurs in the first trimester. For some women and their partners, miscarriages can happen several times, also known as recurrent miscarriages. While there are sometimes causes for miscarriages that are found, often no clear reasons can be found. The hormone called progesterone prepares the womb (uterus) to receive and support the newly fertilized egg during the early part of pregnancy. It has been suggested that some women who miscarry may not make enough progesterone in the early part of pregnancy. Supplementing these women with medications that act like progesterone (these are called progestogens) has been suggested as a possible way to prevent recurrent miscarriage. Why is this important? Having miscarriages can be both physically and emotionally difficult for women and their partners. Finding a therapy to help reduce recurrent miscarriages could help them avoid a miscarriage and have a live baby. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence on 6 July 2017 and identified a total of 13 trials that enrolled a total of 2556 women with a history of recurrent miscarriages. These trials found that giving progestogen medication to women with recurrent miscarriages early in their pregnancy may help lower the rates of miscarriage in that pregnancy from 26.3% to 19.4%. We believe that these findings are based on evidence of only moderate quality, so we cannot be certain about the results. We found that progestogen treatment may be most helpful for women who had had at least three miscarriages before they started the study. We did not find that giving the progestogen medication by mouth, as a shot (injection), or in the vagina was any better than any of the other ways. We also found that the trials showed that giving progestogen to women with prior recurrent miscarriages made the chances of having a live baby in the current pregnancy slightly higher. While we found evidence that giving progestogens to women in these groups might lower the rate of having a baby too early or having a stillbirth, this evidence was not very strong and should be backed up with more studies. We did not find evidence of improvement in other outcomes such as newborn death, low birthweight, or newborn birth defects for women given progestogens. What does this mean? We found evidence from randomized controlled trials that giving progestogen medication can probably prevent miscarriage for women with recurrent previous miscarriages.	10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	523	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

With the increasing rate of CS, it is important to minimise the risks to the mother as much as possible. This review focused on different forms and methods of preoperative skin preparation to prevent infection. This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2012, and updated in 2014. Objectives To compare the effects of different antiseptic agents, different methods of application, or different forms of antiseptic used for preoperative skin preparation for preventing postcaesarean infection. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (27 November 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials, evaluating any type of preoperative skin preparation agents, forms, and methods of application for caesarean section. Comparisons of interest in this review were between different antiseptic agents used for CS skin preparation (e.g. alcohol, povidone iodine), different methods of antiseptic application (e.g. scrub, paint, drape), different forms of antiseptic (e.g. powder, liquid), and also between different skin preparations, such as a plastic incisional drape, which may or may not be impregnated with antiseptic agents. Only studies involving the preparation of the incision area were included. This review did not cover studies of preoperative handwashing by the surgical team or preoperative bathing. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed all potential studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data using a predesigned form. We checked data for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results For this update, we included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 6237 women who were undergoing CS. Ten trials (6215 women) contributed data to this review. All included studies were individual RCTs. We did not identify any quasi‐ or cluster‐RCTs. The trial dates ranged from 1983 to 2016. Six trials were conducted in the USA, and the remainder in Nigeria, South Africa, France, Denmark, and Indonesia. The included studies were broadly methodologically sound, but raised some specific concerns regarding risk of bias in a number of cases. Drape versus no drape This comparison investigated the use of a non‐impregnated drape versus no drape, following preparation of the skin with antiseptics. For women undergoing CS, low‐quality evidence suggested that using a drape before surgery compared with no drape, may make little or no difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.71; 2 trials, 1294 women), or length of stay in the hospital (mean difference (MD) 0.10 day, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.46 1 trial, 603 women). One‐minute alcohol scrub with iodophor drape versus five‐minute iodophor scrub without drape One trial compared an alcohol scrub and iodophor drape with a five‐minute iodophor scrub only, and reported no surgical site infection in either group (79 women, very‐low quality evidence). We were uncertain whether the combination of a one‐minute alcohol scrub and a drape reduced the incidence of endomyometritis when compared with a five‐minute scrub, because the quality of the evidence was very low (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 9.16; 1 trial, 79 women). Parachlorometaxylenol with iodine versus iodine alone We were uncertain whether parachlorometaxylenol with iodine before CS made any difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.99; 1 trial, 50 women), or endometritis (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.38; 1 trial, 50 women) when compared with iodine alone, because the quality of the evidence was very low. Chlorhexidine gluconate versus pov done iodine Low‐quality evidence suggested that chlorhexidine gluconate before CS, when compared with povidone iodine, may make little or no difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.02; 6 trials, 3607 women). However, surgical site infection appeared to be slightly reduced for women for whom chlorhexidine gluconate was used compared with povidone iodine after we removed four trials at high risk of bias for outcome assessment, in a sensitivity analysis (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95; 2 trials, 1321 women). Low‐quality evidence indicated that chlorhexidine gluconate before CS, when compared with povidone iodine, may make little or no difference to the incidence of endometritis (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.01; 2 trials, 2079 women), or to reducing maternal skin irritation or allergic skin reaction (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.63; 2 trials, 1521 women). One small study (60 women) reported reduced bacterial growth at 18 hours after CS for women who had chlorhexidine gluconate preparation compared with women who had povidone iodine preparation (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70). None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality or repeat surgery. Chlorhexidine 0.5% versus 70% alcohol plus drape One trial, which was only available as an abstract, investigated the effect of skin preparation on neonatal adverse events, and found cord blood iodine concentration to be higher in the iodine group. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence available from the included RCTs to fully evaluate different agents and methods of skin preparation for preventing infection following caesarean section. Therefore, it is not yet clear what sort of skin preparation may be most effective for preventing postcaesarean surgical site infection, or for reducing other undesirable outcomes for mother and baby. Most of the evidence in this review was deemed to be very low or low quality. This means that for most findings, our confidence in any evidence of an intervention effect is limited, and indicates the need for more high‐quality research. This field needs high quality, well designed RCTs, with larger sample sizes. High priority questions include comparing types of antiseptic (especially iodine versus chlorhexidine), and application methods (scrubbing, swabbing, or draping). We found four studies that were ongoing; we will incorporate the results of these studies in future updates of this review. Plain language summary Skin preparation for preventing infection following caesarean section This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2012, and updated in 2014. What is the issue?   The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what methods of skin preparation before caesarean section were most effective in preventing infection after the operation. We collected and analysed all studies that assessed the effectiveness of antiseptics used to prepare the skin before making an incision (or cut) for the caesarean section. We only included analysis of preparations that were used to prepare the surgical site on the abdomen before caesarean section; we did not look at handwashing by the surgical team, or bathing the mother. Why is this important?   Infections of surgical incisions are the third most frequently reported hospital‐acquired infections. Women who give birth by caesarean section are exposed to infection from germs already present on the mother's own skin, or from external sources. The risk of infection following a caesarean section can be 10 times that of vaginal birth. Therefore, preventing infection by properly preparing the skin before the incision is made is an important part of the overall care given to women prior to caesarean birth. An antiseptic is a substance applied to remove bacteria that can cause harm to the mother or baby when they multiply. Antiseptics include iodine or povidone iodine, alcohol, chlorhexidine, and parachlorometaxylenol. They can be applied as liquids or powders, scrubs, paints, swabs, or on impregnated 'drapes' that stick to the skin, whic the surgeon then cuts through. Non‐impregnated drapes can also be applied, once the skin has been scrubbed or swapped, with the aim of reducing the spread of any remaining bacteria during surgery. It is important to know if some of these antiseptics or methods work better than others. What evidence did we find?   This updated review included 11 trials with 6237 women. Six trials were conducted in the United States; the remaining trials were in Nigeria, South Africa, France, Denmark, and Indonesia. The review looked at what was best for women and babies when it came to important outcomes including: infection of the site where the surgeon cut the woman to perform the caesarean section; inflammation of the lining of the womb (metritis and endometritis); how long the woman stayed in hospital; and any other adverse effects, such as irritation of the woman's skin, or any reported impact on the baby. Not all of the 11 trials explored all of these outcomes, and the evidence for each outcome was usually based on results from far fewer than 6237 women. Much of the evidence we found was of relatively poor quality, due to limits in the ways that the studies were conducted. This means that we could not be certain about most of the findings, even when we combined the results from a number of different studies. The evidence suggested that there was probably little or no difference between the various antiseptics in the incidence of surgical site infection, endometritis, skin irritation, or allergic skin reaction in the mother. However, in one study, there was a reduction in bacterial growth on the skin at 18 hours after caesarean section for women who received a skin preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate compared with women who received the skin preparation with povidone iodine, but more data are needed to see if this actually reduces infections for women. What does this mean?   The available evidence from the trials that have been conducted was insufficient to tell us the best type of skin preparation for preventing surgical site infection following caesarean section. More high‐quality research is needed. We found four studies that were still ongoing. We will incorporate the results of these studies into this review in future updates.	10.1002/14651858.CD007462.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	516	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007462.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

For several decades low protein diets have been proposed for participants with CKD with the aim of slowing the progression to end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) and delaying the onset of renal replacement therapy. However the relative benefits and harms of dietary protein restriction for preventing progression of CKD have not been resolved. This is an update of a systematic review first published in 2000 and updated in 2006 and 2009. Objectives To determine the efficacy of low protein diets in preventing the natural progression of CKD towards ESKD and in delaying the need for commencing dialysis treatment in non‐diabetic adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 2 March 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi RCTs in which adults with non‐diabetic chronic kidney disease (stages 3 to 5) not on dialysis were randomised to receive a very low protein intake (0.3 to 0.4 g/kg/d) compared with a low protein intake (0.5 to 0.6 g/kg/d) or a low protein intake compared with a normal protein intake (≥ 0.8 g/kg/d) for 12 months or more. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes (death, all causes), requirement for dialysis, adverse effects) the risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and summary statistics estimated using the random effects model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used (glomerular filtration rate (GFR), weight), these data were analysed as the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results We identified an additional six studies to include 17 studies with 2996 analysed participants (range 19 to 840). Four larger multicentre studies were subdivided according to interventions so that the review included 21 separate data sets. Mean duration of participant follow‐up ranged from 12 to 50 months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were considered at low risk of bias in eleven and nine studies respectively. All studies were considered at high risk for performance bias as they were open‐label studies. We assessed detection bias for outcome assessment for GFR and ESKD separately. As GFR measurement was a laboratory outcome all studies were assessed at low risk of detection bias. For ESKD, nine studies were at low risk of detection bias as the need to commence dialysis was determined by personnel independent of the study investigators. Five studies were assessed at high risk of attrition bias with eleven studies at low risk. Ten studies were at high risk for reporting bias as they did not include data which could be included in a meta‐analysis. Eight studies reported funding from government bodies while the remainder did not report on funding. Ten studies compared a low protein diet with a normal protein diet in participants with CKD categories 3a and b (9 studies) or 4 (one study). There was probably little or no difference in the numbers of participants who died (5 studies 1680 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; 13 fewer deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). A low protein diet may make little or no difference in the number of participants who reached ESKD compared with a normal protein diet (6 studies, 1814 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.53; 7 more per 1000 reached ESKD; low certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a low protein diet compared with a normal protein intake impacts on the outcome of final or change in GFR (8 studies, 1680 participants: SMD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.75 to 0.38; very low certainty evidence). Eight studies compared a very low protein diet with a low protein diet and two studies compared a very low protein diet with a normal protein diet. A very low protein intake compared with a low protein intake probably made little or no difference to death (6 studies, 681 participants: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.54; 10 more deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). However it probably reduces the number who reach ESKD (10 studies, 1010 participants: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; 165 per 1000 fewer reached ESKD; moderate certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a very low protein diet compared with a low or normal protein intake influences the final or change in GFR (6 studies, 456 participants: SMD 0.12, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.52; very low certainty evidence). Final body weight was reported in only three studies. It is uncertain whether the intervention alters final body weight (3 studies, 89 participants: MD ‐0.40 kg, 95% CI ‐6.33 to 5.52; very low certainty evidence).Twelve studies reported no evidence of protein energy wasting (malnutrition) in their study participants while three studies reported small numbers of participants in each group with protein energy wasting. Most studies reported that adherence to diet was satisfactory. Quality of life was not formally assessed in any studies. Authors' conclusions This review found that very low protein diets probably reduce the number of people with CKD 4 or 5, who progress to ESKD. In contrast low protein diets may make little difference to the number of people who progress to ESKD. Low or very low protein diets probably do not influence death. However there are limited data on adverse effects such as weight differences and protein energy wasting. There are no data on whether quality of life is impacted by difficulties in adhering to protein restriction. Studies evaluating the adverse effects and the impact on quality of life of dietary protein restriction are required before these dietary approaches can be recommended for widespread use. Plain language summary Low protein diets for non‐diabetic adults with chronic kidney disease What is the issue? Various forms of kidney disease can lead to kidney failure with affected people ultimately requiring dialysis treatment. A diet low in protein may be recommended to try to slow the progress of kidney disease to kidney failure. We still do not know whether low protein diets can slow the progress of kidney disease and delay the need to start dialysis. What did we do? We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 2 March 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCT), which enrolled non‐diabetic adult patients with chronic kidney disease, not yet requiring dialysis, and which compared different dietary protein intakes, including very low (0.3 to 0.4 g/kg/d), low (0.5 to 0.6 g/kg/d) or normal protein intakes (≥ 0.8 g/kg/d) for 12 months or more. What did we find? We examined the evidence from 17 studies (21 data sets) with 2996 people with reduced kidney function. We found that very low protein diets compared with low or normal protein intakes probably reduce the number of people with advanced kidney failure, who progress to dialysis. When low protein diets were compared with normal protein diets, there was little of no difference in the number of people with less severe kidney failure, who progressed to dialysis. Side effects of low protein diets such as weight loss were uncommon but many studies did not report on side effects. Conclusions In people with advanced kidney failure, a very low protein intake probably slows the progress to kidney failure. However we need more information on the side effects of low protein diets and on whether quality of life is reduced because of difficulties in keeping to such a diet.	10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	477	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Objectives To determine whether or not regular (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) treatment of COPD patients with prophylactic antibiotics reduces exacerbations or affects quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was performed on 27 July 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo in patients with COPD. Data collection and analysis We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by involving a third review author. Main results We included 14 studies involving 3932 participants in this review. We identified two further studies meeting inclusion criteria but both were terminated early without providing results. All studies were published between 2001 and 2015. Nine studies were of continuous macrolide antibiotics, two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis (three times per week) and two were of pulsed antibiotic regimens (e.g. five days every eight weeks). The final study included one continuous, one intermittent and one pulsed arm. The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, doxycyline, roxithromycin and moxifloxacin. The study duration varied from three months to 36 months and all used intention‐to‐treat analysis. Most of the pooled results were of moderate quality. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low. The studies recruited participants with a mean age between 65 and 72 years and mostly at least moderate‐severity COPD. Five studies only included participants with frequent exacerbations and two studies recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen. One study recruited participants with pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD and a further study was specifically designed to asses whether eradication of Chlamydia pneumoniae reduced exacerbation rates. The co‐primary outcomes for this review were the number of exacerbations and quality of life. With use of prophylactic antibiotics, the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.78; participants = 2716; studies = 8; moderate‐quality evidence). This represented a reduction from 61% of participants in the control group compared to 47% in the treatment group (95% CI 39% to 55%). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome with prophylactic antibiotics given for three to 12 months to prevent one person from experiencing an exacerbation (NNTB) was 8 (95% CI 5 to 17). The test for subgroup difference suggested that continuous and intermittent antibiotics may be more effective than pulsed antibiotics (P = 0.02, I² = 73.3%). The frequency of exacerbations per patient per year was also reduced with prophylactic antibiotic treatment (rate ratio 0.67; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; participants = 1384; studies = 5; moderate‐quality evidence). Although we were unable to pool the result, six of the seven studies reporting time to first exacerbation identified an increase (i.e. benefit) with antibiotics, which was reported as statistically significant in four studies. There was a statistically significant improvement in quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) with prophylactic antibiotic treatment, but this was smaller than the four unit improvement that is regarded as being clinically significant (mean difference (MD) ‐1.94, 95% CI ‐3.13 to ‐0.75; participants = 2237; studies = 7, high‐quality evidence). Prophylactic antibiotics showed no significant effect on the econdary outcomes of frequency of hospital admissions, change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), serious adverse events or all‐cause mortality (moderate‐quality evidence). There was some evidence of benefit in exercise tolerance, but this was driven by a single study of lower methodological quality. The adverse events that were recorded varied among the studies depending on the antibiotics used. Azithromycin was associated with significant hearing loss in the treatment group, which was in many cases reversible or partially reversible. The moxifloxacin pulsed study reported a significantly higher number of adverse events in the treatment arm due to the marked increase in gastrointestinal adverse events (P < 0.001). Some adverse events that led to drug discontinuation, such as development of long QTc or tinnitus, were not significantly more frequent in the treatment group than the placebo group but pose important considerations in clinical practice. The development of antibiotic resistance in the community is of major concern. Six studies reported on this, but we were unable to combine results. One study found newly colonised participants to have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. Participants colonised with moxifloxacin‐sensitive pseudomonas at initiation of therapy rapidly became resistant with the quinolone treatment. A further study with three active treatment arms found an increase in the degree of antibiotic resistance of isolates in all three arms after 13 weeks treatment. Authors' conclusions Use of continuous and intermittent prophylactic antibiotics results in a clinically significant benefit in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients. All studies of continuous and intermittent antibiotics used macrolides, hence the noted benefit applies only to the use of macrolide antibiotics prescribed at least three times per week. The impact of pulsed antibiotics remains uncertain and requires further research. The studies in this review included mostly participants who were frequent exacerbators with at least moderate‐severity COPD. There were also older individuals with a mean age over 65 years. The results of these studies apply only to the group of participants who were studied in these studies and may not be generalisable to other groups. Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse. Monitoring of significant side effects including hearing loss, tinnitus, and long QTc in the community in this elderly patient group may require extra health resources. Plain language summary Preventative antibiotic therapy for people with COPD What is COPD? COPD is a common chronic respiratory disease mainly affecting people who smoke now or have done so previously. It could become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. People with COPD experience gradually worsening shortness of breath and cough with sputum (phlegm) because of permanent damage to their airways and lungs. Those with COPD may have flare‐ups (or exacerbations) most commonly with respiratory infections. Exacerbations may lead to further irreversible loss of lung function, as well as days off work, hospital admission, reduction in quality of life, or even death. Why did we do this review? We wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent a flare‐up ('prophylactic' antibiotics) would reduce the frequency of flare‐ups and improve quality of life. Studies that were taken into consideration used either continuous prophylactic antibiotics (every day), or antibiotics that were used intermittently (three times per week) or pulsed (e.g. for five days every eight weeks) What evidence did we find? We carried out the latest search for studies in July 2018. We found 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3932 participants. All studies were published between 2001 and 2015. Nine studies were of continuous antibiotics, wo studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis and two were of pulsed antibiotics. The final study included one continuous, one intermittent, one pulsed and one placebo arm. The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, doxycycline and moxifloxacin. On average, the people involved in the studies were 65 to 72 years old and had moderate or severe COPD. Three studies included participants with frequent exacerbations and two of the studies recruited participants requiring steroid tablets or antibiotics or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen. One study only included people with a particular complication of COPD, involving the heart and blood vessels in the lungs (known as pulmonary hypertension). Results and conclusions We found that, with the use of antibiotics, the number of participants who developed an exacerbation reduced markedly. For every eight participants treated, one person would be prevented from suffering an exacerbation. However, not all the antibiotic regimens had the same impact on exacerbations. The results suggested that antibiotics given at least three times per week may be more effective than antibiotics given daily for a few days followed by a break of several weeks. We also found there may have been a benefit on patient‐reported quality of life with the antibiotics. On the other hand, use of antibiotics did not significantly affect the number of deaths due to any cause, the frequency of hospitalisation, or the loss of lung function during the study period. Even though there may be fewer exacerbations with antibiotics, there are considerable drawbacks of taking antibiotics. First, there were specific adverse events associated with the antibiotics, which differed according to the antibiotic used; second, patients have to take antibiotics regularly for months or years; finally, the resulting increase in antibiotic resistance will have implications for both individual patients and the wider community through reducing the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics. Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.	10.1002/14651858.CD009764.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	517	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009764.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Early enteral nutrition within 24 hours of lower gastrointestinal surgery versus later commencement for length of hospital stay and postoperative complications	Herbert GP, R.  Andersen, H. K.  Atkinson, C.  Penfold, C.  Lewis, S. J.  Ness, A. R.  Thomas, S.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Enteral Nutrition  Colon [*surgery]  Humans  Postoperative Complications [*therapy]  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic  Rectum [*surgery]  Time Factors	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background This is an update of the review last published in 2011. It focuses on early postoperative enteral nutrition after lower gastrointestinal surgery. Traditional management consisted of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids after bowel function has returned. Although several trials have reported lower incidence of infectious complications and faster wound healing upon early feeding, other trials have shown no effect. The immediate advantage of energy intake (carbohydrates, protein or fat) could enhance recovery with fewer complications, and this warrants a systematic evaluation. Objectives To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition (within 24 hours), oral intake and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal), compared with traditional management (delayed nutritional supply) is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (LoS), fewer complications, mortality and adverse events in patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2017, issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 15 November 2017), Ovid Embase (1974 to 15 November 2017). We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 November 2017). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and previous systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing early commencement of enteral nutrition (within 24 hours) with no feeding in adult participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool tailored to this review and extracted data. Data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane recommendations.    We rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE.    Primary outcomes were LoS and postoperative complications (wound infections, intraabdominal abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence, pneumonia).    Secondary outcomes were: mortality, adverse events (nausea, vomiting), and quality of life (QoL).    LoS was estimated using mean difference (MD (presented as mean +/‐ SD). For other outcomes we estimated the common risk ratio (RR) and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used an inverse‐variance random‐effects model for the primary outcome (LoS) and Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects models for the secondary outcomes. We also performed Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA). Main results We identified 17 RCTs with 1437 participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias in two or more domains. Six studies were judged as having low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation and insufficient details were provided for judgement on allocation concealment in all 17 studies. With regards to performance and deception bias; 14 studies reported no attempt to blind participants and blinding of personnel was not discussed either. Only one study was judged as low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessor. With regards to incomplete outcome data, three studies were judged to be at high risk because they had more than 10% difference in missing data between groups. For selective reporting, nine studies were judged as unclear as protocols were not provided and eight studies had issues with either missing data or incomplete reporting of results. LOS was reported in 16 studies (1346 participants). The mean LoS ranged from four days to 16 days in the early feeding groups and from 6.6 days to 23.5 days in the control groups. Mean difference (MD) in LoS was 1.95 (95% CI, ‐2.99 to ‐0.91, P < 0.001) days shorter in the early feeding group. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between included studies (I 2 = 81, %, Chi 2 = 78.98, P < 0.00001), thus the overall quality of vidence for LoS is low. These results were confirmed by the TSA showing that the cumulative Z‐curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit.    We found no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications: wound infection (12 studies, 1181 participants, RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.64 to 1.52, very low‐quality evidence), intraabdominal abscesses (6 studies, 554 participants, RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.26 to 3.80, low‐quality evidence), anastomotic leakage/dehiscence (13 studies, 1232 participants, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.38 to 1.61, low‐quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 100), and pneumonia (10 studies, 954 participants, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.32 to 2.42, low‐quality evidence; NNTB = 333). Mortality was reported in 12 studies (1179 participants), and showed no between‐group differences (RR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.21 to 1.52, P = 0.26, I 2 = 0%, Chi 2 = 3.08, P = 0.96, low‐quality evidence). The most commonly reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, sepsis and acute myocardial infarction. Seven studies (613 participants) reported vomiting (RR 1.23, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.58, P = 0.10, I 2 = 0%, Chi 2 = 4.98, P = 0.55, low‐quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 19), and two studies (118 participants) reported nausea (RR 0.95, 0.71 to 1.26, low‐quality evidence). Four studies reported combined nausea and vomiting (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.74, very low‐quality evidence). One study reported QoL assessment; the scores did not differ between groups at 30 days after discharge on either QoL scale EORTC QLQ‐C30 or EORTC QlQ‐OV28 (very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This review suggests that early enteral feeding may lead to a reduced postoperative LoS, however cautious interpretation must be taken due to substantial heterogeneity and low‐quality evidence. For all other outcomes (postoperative complications, mortality, adverse events, and QoL) the findings are inconclusive, and further trials are justified to enhance the understanding of early feeding for these. In this updated review, only a few additional studies have been included, and these were small and of poor quality.    To improve the evidence, future trials should address quality issues and focus on clearly defining and measuring postoperative complications to allow for better comparison between studies. However due to the introduction of fast track protocols which already include an early feeding component, future trials may be challenging. A more feasible trial may be to investigate the effect of differing postoperative energy intake regimens on relevant outcomes. Plain language summary The effect of having nutrition within the first 24 hours after bowel surgery on length of hospital stay and postoperative complications Review question To look at whether feeding patients early after surgery via their stomach (also known as gastrointestinal surgery) can help them to leave hospital sooner with fewer complications. Background Traditionally, after gastrointestinal surgery, it was usual for patients not to be given any food until their bowel regained some function (e.g. bowel sounds, passing wind, bowel motion). Studies have looked at whether feeding patients sooner after surgery can help reduce complications (e.g. pneumonia), but there are mixed results. It is important to do this update of the review because the evidence in previous reviews is not extensive. The relevance of early feeding following its incorporation within a programme of patient care (also known as the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)), remains an important question to answer. Study characteristics This review found 17 relevant studies that recruited 1437 participants in total who had undergone lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz). Key results We found evidence that patients who received nutrition within the first 24 hours after their surgery were able to leave hospital almost two days sooner than those patients who were not given a y nutrition until their bowel activity returned. However, the quality of the evidence is low and therefore early feeding after surgery may not lead to patients leaving hospital sooner. They may also have a reduced risk of dying. However, we found weak evidence that patients who were given nutrition within the first day after their operation were more at risk of vomiting. There were no differences in complication rates (such as wound infection or pneumonia) between patients who were fed early and those that were not. Quality of the evidence All studies were of low quality, which may mean their results are less reliable. To explore further early feeding after surgery, more studies are needed which are larger and of better quality.	10.1002/14651858.CD004080.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	505	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004080.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Ergonomic interventions for preventing work‐related musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb and neck among office workers	Hoe VCWU, D. M.  Kelsall, H. L.  Zamri, E. N.  Sim, M. R.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Neck  *Upper Extremity  Adult  Computer Peripherals  Equipment Design  Ergonomics [*methods]  Humans  Musculoskeletal Diseases [*prevention & control]  Occupational Diseases [*prevention & control]  Orthotic Devices  Patient Education as Topic [methods]  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic  Rest	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Work‐related upper limb and neck musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most common occupational disorders worldwide. Studies have shown that the percentage of office workers that suffer from MSDs ranges from 20 to 60 per cent. The direct and indirect costs of work‐related upper limb MSDs have been reported to be high in Europe, Australia, and the United States. Although ergonomic interventions are likely to reduce the risk of office workers developing work‐related upper limb and neck MSDs, the evidence is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was last published in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects of physical, cognitive and organisational ergonomic interventions, or combinations of those interventions for the prevention of work‐related upper limb and neck MSDs among office workers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science (Science Citation Index), SPORTDiscus, Embase, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health database, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to 10 October 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ergonomic interventions for preventing work‐related upper limb or neck MSDs (or both) among office workers. We only included studies where the baseline prevalence of MSDs of the upper limb or neck, or both, was less than 25%. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included studies with relevant data that we judged to be sufficiently homogeneous regarding the interventions and outcomes in the meta‐analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 15 RCTs (2165 workers). We judged one study to have a low risk of bias and the remaining 14 studies to have a high risk of bias due to small numbers of participants and the potential for selection bias. Physical ergonomic interventions There is inconsistent evidence for arm supports and alternative computer mouse designs. There is moderate‐quality evidence that an arm support with an alternative computer mouse (two studies) reduced the incidence of neck or shoulder MSDs (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.99), but not the incidence of right upper limb MSDs (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.66); and low‐quality evidence that this intervention reduced neck or shoulder discomfort (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.41; 95% CI −0.69 to −0.12) and right upper limb discomfort (SMD −0.34; 95% CI −0.63 to −0.06). There is moderate‐quality evidence that the incidence of neck or shoulder and right upper limb disorders were not considerably reduced when comparing an alternative computer mouse and a conventional mouse (two studies; neck or shoulder: RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.19 to 2.00; right upper limb: RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72), and also when comparing an arm support with a conventional mouse and a conventional mouse alone (two studies) (neck or shoulder: RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.12 to 6.98; right upper limb: RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.96). Workstation adjustment (one study) and sit‐stand desks (one study) did not have an effect on upper limb pain or discomfort, compared to no intervention. Organisational ergonomic interventions There is very low‐quality evidence that supplementary breaks (two studies) reduce discomfort of the neck (MD −0.25; 95% CI −0.40 to −0.11), right shoulder or upper arm (MD −0.33; 95% CI −0.46 to −0.19), and right forearm or wrist or hand (MD ‐0.18; 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.08) among data entry workers. Training in ergonomic interventions There is low to very low‐quality evidence in five studies that participatory and active training interventions may or may not prevent work‐related MSDs of the upper limb or neck or both. Multifaceted ergonomic interventions For multifacete interventions there is one study (very low‐quality evidence) that showed no effect on any of the six upper limb pain outcomes measured in that study. Authors' conclusions We found inconsistent evidence that the use of an arm support or an alternative mouse may or may not reduce the incidence of neck or shoulder MSDs. For other physical ergonomic interventions there is no evidence of an effect. For organisational interventions, in the form of supplementary breaks, there is very low‐quality evidence of an effect on upper limb discomfort. For training and multifaceted interventions there is no evidence of an effect on upper limb pain or discomfort. Further high‐quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions among office workers. Plain language summary Ergonomic interventions for preventing work‐related musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb and neck among office workers What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if ergonomic interventions can prevent musculoskeletal pain or discomfort or both (musculoskeletal disorders; MSDs) among office workers. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 15 studies. Key messages We found physical ergonomic interventions, such as using an arm support with a computer mouse based on neutral posture, may or may not prevent work‐related MSDs among office workers. We are still uncertain of the effectiveness of the other physical, organisational and cognitive ergonomic interventions. What was studied in the review? We selected office workers in our review, as they are a working population that has a higher risk for developing MSDs of the upper limb and neck. We assessed the effect of using ergonomic principles to improve the workplace and working process. Ergonomic refers to interactions among workers and other elements in the working environment, which includes physical, organisational and cognitive components. Physical ergonomic interventions include improving the equipment and environment of the workplace. The aim of these methods is to reduce the physical strain to the musculoskeletal system, thus reducing risk of injury. Meanwhile, organisational ergonomic interventions consist of allowing optimum workplace and rest time for the musculoskeletal system to recover from fatigue, thus reducing the risk of long‐term injury. Cognitive ergonomic interventions consist of improving mental processes such as perception, memory, reasoning and motor response through modifying work processes and training. The aim of these methods is to reduce mental workload, increase reliability and reduce error, which may have an indirect effect on reducing strain on the musculoskeletal system. What are the main results of the review? We found 15 studies that included 2165 workers. Fourteen of the studies conducted and reported their work poorly, and most of the studies had a small number of participants. Out of the 15 studies, five studies evaluated the effectiveness of physical ergonomic interventions. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of organisational ergonomic interventions, in the form of breaks or reduced working hours in preventing work‐related MSDs of the upper limb or neck, or both, among office workers. Five studies evaluated the effectiveness of ergonomic training, and one study evaluated multifaceted ergonomic interventions. We did not find any studies evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive ergonomic interventions. Physical ergonomic interventions We found that the use of an arm support or a mouse based on neutral posture may or may not prevent work‐related MSDs of the neck and shoulder. Workstation adjustment, and sit‐stand desks do not have an effect on upper limb pain compared to no intervention. Organisational ergonomic interventions We found that supplementary breaks may reduce neck and upper limb discomfort among data entry workers (two studies). Cognitive ergonomic interventions We found no studies using these methods. Training interventions There is no effec on upper limb pain compared to no intervention in five studies. Mutlifaceted ergonomic interventions There is no effect on pain or discomfort compared to no intervention in one study. This means that there remains a need to conduct further studies to assess the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 10 October 2018.	10.1002/14651858.CD008570.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	502	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008570.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Calcium supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, and may help to prevent preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of calcium supplementation during pregnancy on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and related maternal and child outcomes. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (18 September 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised trials, comparing high‐dose calcium supplementation (at least 1 g daily of calcium) during pregnancy with placebo. For low‐dose calcium we included quasi‐randomised trials, trials without placebo, trials with cointerventions and dose comparison trials. Data collection and analysis Two researchers independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two researchers assessed the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 27 studies (18,064 women). We assessed the included studies as being at low risk of bias, although bias was frequently difficult to assess due to poor reporting and inadequate information on methods. High‐dose calcium supplementation ( ≥ 1 g/day) versus placebo Fourteen studies examined this comparison, however one study contributed no data. The 13 studies contributed data from 15,730 women to our meta‐analyses. The average risk of high blood pressure (BP) was reduced with calcium supplementation compared with placebo (12 trials, 15,470 women: risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.81; I² = 74%). There was also a reduction in the risk of pre‐eclampsia associated with calcium supplementation (13 trials, 15,730 women: average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.65; I² = 70%; low‐quality evidence). This effect was clear for women with low calcium diets (eight trials, 10,678 women: average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65; I² = 76%) but not those with adequate calcium diets. The effect appeared to be greater for women at higher risk of pre‐eclampsia, though this may be due to small‐study effects (five trials, 587 women: average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.42). These data should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of small‐study effects or publication bias. In the largest trial, the reduction in pre‐eclampsia was modest (8%) and the CI included the possibility of no effect. The composite outcome maternal death or serious morbidity was reduced with calcium supplementation (four trials, 9732 women; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98). Maternal deaths were no different (one trial of 8312 women: one death in the calcium group versus six in the placebo group). There was an anomalous increase in the risk of HELLP syndrome in the calcium group (two trials, 12,901 women: RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.82, high‐quality evidence), however, the absolute number of events was low (16 versus six). The average risk of preterm birth was reduced in the calcium supplementation group (11 trials, 15,275 women: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; I² = 60%; low‐quality evidence); this reduction was greatest amongst women at higher risk of developing pre‐eclampsia (four trials, 568 women: average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.83; I² = 60%). Again, these data should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of small‐study effects or publication bias. There was no clear effect on admission to neonatal intensive care. There was also no clear effect on the risk of stillbirth or infant death before discharge from hospital (11 trials, 15,665 babies: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09). One study showed a reduction in childhood systolic BP greater than 95th percentile among children exposed to calcium supplementation in utero (514 children: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.91). In a subse of these children, dental caries at 12 years old was also reduced (195 children, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87). Low‐dose calcium supplementation (< 1 g/day) versus placebo or no treatment Twelve trials (2334 women) evaluated low‐dose (usually 500 mg daily) supplementation with calcium alone (four trials) or in association with vitamin D (five trials), linoleic acid (two trials), or antioxidants (one trial). Most studies recruited women at high risk for pre‐eclampsia, and were at high risk of bias, thus the results should be interpreted with caution. Supplementation with low doses of calcium reduced the risk of pre‐eclampsia (nine trials, 2234 women: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.52). There was also a reduction in high BP (five trials, 665 women: RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (one trial, 422 women, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.99), but not preterm birth (six trials, 1290 women, average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.03), or stillbirth or death before discharge (five trials, 1025 babies, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.67). High‐dose (=/> 1 g) versus low‐dose (< 1 g) calcium supplementation We included one trial with 262 women, the results of which should be interpreted with caution due to unclear risk of bias. Risk of pre‐eclampsia appeared to be reduced in the high‐dose group (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.96). No other differences were found (preterm birth: RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08; eclampsia: RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.53; stillbirth: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.83). Authors' conclusions High‐dose calcium supplementation (≥ 1 g/day) may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia and preterm birth, particularly for women with low calcium diets (low‐quality evidence). The treatment effect may be overestimated due to small‐study effects or publication bias. It reduces the occurrence of the composite outcome 'maternal death or serious morbidity', but not stillbirth or neonatal high care admission. There was an increased risk of HELLP syndrome with calcium supplementation, which was small in absolute numbers. The limited evidence on low‐dose calcium supplementation suggests a reduction in pre‐eclampsia, hypertension and admission to neonatal high care, but needs to be confirmed by larger, high‐quality trials. Plain language summary Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing blood pressure disorders and related problems What is the issue? Pre‐eclampsia is evident as high blood pressure and protein in the urine. It is a major cause of death in pregnant women and newborn babies worldwide. Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) is often caused by high blood pressure and is the leading cause of newborn deaths, particularly in low‐income countries. Why is this important? Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that calcium supplements help prevent pre‐eclampsia and preterm birth and lower the risk of a woman dying or having serious problems related to high blood pressure in pregnancy. This is particularly for women on low calcium diets. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence on 18 September 2017, and found 27 trials. We found evidence from 13 studies (involving 15,730 women) that calcium supplementation in high doses (at least 1 gram (g) daily) during pregnancy may be a safe way of reducing the risk of pre‐eclampsia, especially in women from communities with low dietary calcium and those at increased risk of pre‐eclampsia. Women receiving calcium supplements may also be less likely to die or have serious problems related to pre‐eclampsia (low‐quality evidence) and high blood pressure. Babies may be less likely to be born preterm (low‐quality evidence). The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets was increased with calcium, but the absolute numbers were small (high‐quality evidence). High‐dose calcium did not have a clear effect on babies admitted to neonatal intensive care, or the number of stillbirths or deaths before discharge from hospital. Further research is needed into the ideal dosage of supplementati n. Limited evidence from 12 trials (2334 women) suggested that a relatively low dose of calcium may be effective in reducing pre‐eclampsia, high blood pressure, and babies admitted to intensive care (however, the quality of the evidence on calcium alone was reduced because eight of the included trials gave other medicines alongside calcium, such as vitamin D, linoleic acid or antioxidants). Low‐dose calcium did not have a clear effect on preterm birth, stillbirth or death before discharge from hospital. One small study compared high‐dose calcium with low‐dose calcium. Pre‐eclampsia appeared to be reduced in the high‐dose group, but no other differences were found in preterm birth, or stillbirth. What does this mean? In settings where dietary calcium is low, supplementation is an important strategy to reduce the serious consequences of pre‐eclampsia. Where high‐dose supplementation is not feasible, the option of lower dose supplements (500 milligrams (mg) to 600 mg daily) might be considered in preference to no supplementation.	10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub5	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	530	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub5	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Several additional randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating biocompatible solutions in PD patients have been published recently. This is an update of a review first published in 2014. Objectives This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of biocompatible PD solutions in comparison to standard PD solutions in patients receiving PD. Search methods The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register was searched up to 12 February 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs in adults and children comparing the effects of biocompatible PD solutions (neutral pH, lactate‐buffered, low GDP; neutral pH, bicarbonate(± lactate)‐buffered, low GDP; glucose polymer (icodextrin)) in PD were included. Studies of amino acid‐based solutions were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data on study quality and outcomes. Summary effect estimates were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables, and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous variables. Main results This review update included 42 eligible studies (3262 participants), including six new studies (543 participants). Overall, 29 studies (1971 participants) compared neutral pH, low GDP PD solution with conventional PD solution, and 13 studies (1291 participants) compared icodextrin with conventional PD solution. Risk of bias was assessed as high for sequence generation in three studies, allocation concealment in three studies, attrition bias in 21 studies, and selective outcome reporting bias in 16 studies. Neutral pH, low GDP versus conventional glucose PD solution Use of neutral pH, low GDP PD solutions improved residual renal function (RRF) preservation (15 studies, 835 participants: SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.33; high certainty evidence). This approximated to a mean difference in glomerular filtration rate of 0.54 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.93). Better preservation of RRF was evident at all follow‐up durations with progressively greater preservation observed with increasing follow up duration. Neutral pH, low GDP PD solution use also improved residual urine volume preservation (11 studies, 791 participants: MD 114.37 mL/day, 95% CI 47.09 to 181.65; high certainty evidence). In low certainty evidence, neutral pH, low GDP solutions may make little or no difference to 4‐hour peritoneal ultrafiltration (9 studies, 414 participants: SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.10) which approximated to a mean difference in peritoneal ultrafiltration of 69.72 mL (16.60 to 122.00 mL) lower, and may increase dialysate:plasma creatinine ratio (10 studies, 746 participants: MD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.03), technique failure or death compared with conventional PD solutions. It is uncertain whether neutral pH, low GDP PD solution use led to any differences in peritonitis occurrence, hospitalisation, adverse events (6 studies, 519 participants) or inflow pain (1 study, 58 participants: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.08). Glucose polymer (icodextrin) versus conventional glucose PD solution In moderate certainty evidence, icodextrin probably reduced episodes of uncontrolled fluid overload (2 studies, 100 participants: RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.59) and augmented peritoneal ultrafiltration (4 studies, 102 participants: MD 448.54 mL/d, 95% CI 289.28 to 607.80) without compromising RRF (4 studies, 114 participants: SM 0.12, 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.49; low certainty evidence) which approximated to a mean creatinine clearance of 0.30 mL/min/1.73m 2 higher (0.65 lower to 1.23 higher) or urine output (3 studies, 69 participants: MD ‐88.88 mL/d, 95% CI ‐356.88 to 179.12; low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether icodextrin use led to any differences in adverse events (5 studies, 816 participants) technique failure or death. Authors' conclusions This updated review strengthens evidence that neutral pH, low GDP PD solution improves RRF and urine volume preservation with high certainty. These effects may be related to increased peritoneal solute transport and reduced peritoneal ultrafiltration, although the evidence for these outcomes is of low certainty due to significant heterogeneity and suboptimal methodological quality. Icodextrin prescription increased peritoneal ultrafiltration and mitigated uncontrolled fluid overload with moderate certainty. The effects of either neutral pH, low GDP solution or icodextrin on peritonitis, technique survival and patient survival remain uncertain and require further high quality, adequately powered RCTs. Plain language summary Biocompatible dialysis fluids for peritoneal dialysis What is the issue? Peritoneal dialysis is a form of dialysis therapy for people with kidney failure delivered at home. Patients are required to use peritoneal dialysis solutions to perform the dialysis by putting solution in their abdomen. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen called the “peritoneal membrane” as a filter, across which toxins and fluids are removed from the body. The longevity of peritoneal dialysis can be limited by peritoneal membrane injury, which is partly as a result of biologically 'unfriendly' peritoneal dialysis solutions, which are acidic and consist of high levels of glucose and toxic glucose breakdown products. To overcome these hurdles, biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solutions (i.e. with a neutral pH and low levels of glucose breakdown products or with a glucose‐alternative like icodextrin) have been manufactured with the aim of providing patient benefit. What did we do? We conducted a review of the literature to examine the benefits and harms from the use of biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solutions. What did we find? We identified 42 studies (3262 participants) examining the effects of these solutions on patient outcomes. When compared to conventional peritoneal dialysis solutions, we found that neutral pH, low glucose breakdown product peritoneal dialysis solutions resulted in better preservation of a patient's own kidney function including urine output. Patients who received non‐glucose based (icodextrin) peritoneal dialysis solutions achieved greater fluid removal with their dialysis and were 70% less likely to experience uncontrolled episodes of fluid overload. No significant harms were identified with any of the biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solutions. Many of the studies were limited by small size, short follow‐up duration, suboptimal methodological quality, and inconsistent reporting of outcomes. Consequently, the effects of biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solutions on the length of time that a patient is able to either remain on peritoneal dialysis or stay alive are uncertain. Conclusions   Compared with peritoneal dialysis patients treated with conventional peritoneal dialysis solutions, those treated with biocompatible solutions experience important benefits including better preservation of their own kidney function and urine volume with neutral pH, low glucose breakdown product peritoneal dialysis solutions and more effective prevention of fluid overload due to increased dialysis‐related fluid removal with icodextrin. Whether these benefits help patients to stay on peritoneal dialysis longer or live longer are uncertain and require further study.	10.1002/14651858.CD007554.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	527	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007554.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Treatment aims are to relieve symptoms and prevent disease‐related complications. Naftopidil is an alpha‐blocker (AB) that has a high affinity for the A1d receptor that may have advantages in treating LUTS in this setting. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. Since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant. Objectives To evaluate the effects of naftopidil for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILAC, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up to 31 May 2018 Selection criteria We included all parallel RCTs. We also included cross‐over design trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Primary outcomes were urological symptom scores, quality of life (QoL) and treatment withdrawals for any reason; secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, acute urinary retention, surgical intervention for BPH, and cardiovascular and sexual adverse events. We considered outcomes measured up to 12 months after randomisation as short term, and later than 12 months as long term. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. Main results We included 22 RCTs with 2223 randomised participants across four comparisons for short‐term follow‐up. This abstract focuses on only two of four comparisons for which we found data since two comparators (i.e. propiverine and Eviprostat (phytotherapy)) are rarely used. One study comparing naftopidil to placebo did not report any relevant outcomes and was therefore excluded. There were no trials that compared to combination therapy with naftopidil or any 5‐alpha reductase inhibitors (5‐ARIs) to combination therapy with other ABs and any 5‐ARIs. All included studies were conducted in Asian countries. Study duration ranged from four to 12 weeks. Mean age was 67.8 years, prostate volume was 35.4 mL, and International Prostate Symptom Score was 18.3. We were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on age and baseline symptom score. Naftopidil versus tamsulosin Based on 12 studies with 965 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in urological symptom score (mean difference (MD) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) –0.09 to 1.04 measured on a scale from 0 to 35 with higher score representing increased symptoms), QoL (MD 0.11, 95% CI –0.09 to 0.30; measured on a scale from 0 to 6 with higher scores representing worse QoL), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; corresponding to 7 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 32 fewer to 31 more). Naftopidil may have resulted in little to no difference in sexual adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22); this would result in 26 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 43 fewer to 13 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for urological symptom score and low for the other outcomes. Naftopidil versus silodosin Based on five studies with 652 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in the urological symptom scores (MD 1.04, 95% CI –0.78 to 2.85), QoL (MD 0.21, 95% CI –0.23 to 0.66), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.23; corresponding to 26 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 62 fewer to 32 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as low for all t ese outcomes. Naftopidil likely reduced sexual adverse events (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; corresponding to 126 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 139 fewer to 86 fewer). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for sexual adverse events. Authors' conclusions Naftopidil appears to have similar effects in the urological symptom scores and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. Naftopidil has similar sexual adverse events compared to tamsulosin but has fewer compared to silodosin. Plain language summary Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia Review question What are the effects of naftopidil in men with bothersome urinary symptoms due to an enlarged prostate? Background An enlarged prostate (called benign prostatic hyperplasia) can cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms such as having to urinate often during the day or at night, having a weak urine stream, and having the feeling of not emptying the bladder completely. A common reason for these complaints is an enlarged prostate, which is common in older men. Naftopidil is a medication that may help with these symptoms and possibly cause fewer unwanted effects than other medications used for this problem. In this review, we compared naftopidil to other medicines. Study characteristics We included 22 studies with 2223 men. The average age was 68.0 years. These men had mostly symptoms rated as moderate or severe. Key results Naftopidil may have had similar effects on urinary symptoms and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. In terms of unwanted effects, naftopidil may have had similar unwanted sexual side effects compared to tamsulosin but have fewer compared to silodosin.

JOUR	[BLANK]	Monotherapy laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular oedema	Jorge ECJ, E. N.  Botelho, M.  Farat, J. G.  Virgili, G.  El Dib, R.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a complication of diabetic retinopathy and one of the most common causes of visual impairment in people with diabetes. Clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO) is the most severe form of DMO. Intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy is now the standard treatment for DMO involving the centre of the macula, but laser photocoagulation is still used in milder or non‐central DMO. Objectives To access the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation as monotherapy in the treatment of diabetic macular oedema. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 24 July 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of focal/grid macular laser photocoagulation versus another type or technique of laser treatment and no intervention. We did not compare laser versus other interventions as these are covered by other Cochrane Reviews. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were gain or loss of 3 lines (0.3 logMAR or 15 ETDRS letters) of best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at one year of follow‐up (plus or minus six months) after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes included final or mean change in BCVA, resolution of macular oedema, central retinal thickness, quality of life and adverse events, all at one year. We graded the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 24 studies (4422 eyes). The trials were conducted in Europe (nine studies), USA (seven), Asia (four) and, Africa (one), Latin America (one), Europe‐Asian (one) and Oceania (one). The methodological quality of the studies was difficult to assess as they were poorly reported, so the predominant classification of bias was unclear. At one year, people with DMO receiving laser were less likely to lose BCVA compared with no intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.90; 3703 eyes; 4 studies; I 2 = 71%; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were also favourable effects observed at two and three years. One study (350 eyes) reported on partial or complete resolution of clinically significant DMO and found moderate‐certainty evidence of a benefit at three years with photocoagulation (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). Data on visual improvement, final BCVA, central macular thickness and quality of life were not available. One study related minor adverse effects on the central visual field and another reported one case of iatrogenic premacular fibrosis. Nine studies compared subthreshold versus standard macular photocoagulation (517 eyes). Subthreshold treatment was achieved with different methods of photocoagulation: non‐visible conventional (two studies), micropulse (four) or nanopulse (one). Only one small study (29 eyes) reported on improvement or worsening of BCVA and estimates were very imprecise (improvement: RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.09; worsening: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.15 to 5.76; very low‐certainty evidence). All studies reported on continuous BCVA at one year; there was low‐certainty evidence of no important difference between subthreshold and standard photocoagulation (mean difference (MD) in logMAR BCVA –0.02, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.03; 385 eyes; 7 studies; I 2 = 42%), and were possibly different for different techniques (P = 0.07 and I 2 = 61.5% for subgroup heterogeneity), with better results achieved with micropulse photocoagulation (MD –0.08 logMAR, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.0) as compared to the results achieved with nanopulse (MD 0.0 logMAR, 95% CI –0.06 to 0.06) and non‐visible conventional (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI –0.03 to 0.11), all of them compared to the standard lasers. One study reported partial to complete resolution of macular oedema at one year. There was low‐certainty evidence of some benefit with standard photocoagulati n, but estimates of effect were imprecise (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.03; 29 eyes; 1 study). Studies also reported on the change in central macular thickness at one year and found moderate‐certainty evidence of no important difference between subthreshold and standard photocoagulation (MD –9.1 μm, 95% CI –26.2 to 8.0; 385 eyes; 7 studies; I 2 = 0%). There were no important adverse effects recorded in the studies. Nine studies compared argon laser versus another type of laser (997 eyes). There was moderate‐certainty evidence of a small reduction or no difference between the interventions, with respect to improvement (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 773 eyes; 6 studies) and worsening of BCVA (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.21; 773 eyes; 6 studies). Three studies reported few cases of subretinal fibrosis and neovascularization with argon laser and one study found subretinal fibrosis in the krypton group. One study (323 eyes) compared the modified ETDRS (mETDRS) grid technique with the mild macular grid (MMG), which uses mild, widely spaced burns throughout the macula. There was low‐certainty evidence of an increased chance of visual improvement with MMG, but the estimate was imprecisely measured and the CIs include an increased risk or decreased risk of visual improvement at one year (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.65; visual worsening: RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.05; change of logMAR visual acuity: MD –0.04 logMAR, 95% CI –0.01 to 0.09). There was a more significant reduction of central macular thickness with the mETDRS compared to the MMG technique (MD –34.0 µm, –59.8 to –8.3) in the MMG group. The study did not record important adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Laser photocoagulation reduces the chances of visual loss and increases those of partial to complete resolution of DMO compared to no intervention at one to three years. Subthreshold photocoagulation, particularly the micropulse technique, may be as effective as standard photocoagulation and RCTs are ongoing to assess whether this minimally invasive technique is preferable to treat milder or non‐central cases of DMO. Plain language summary Single therapy laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular oedema What is the aim of this review?   The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if laser photocoagulation is helpful for treatment of diabetic macular oedema. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 24 studies. Key messages   The review showed that laser photocoagulation could reduce the chance of vision loss. Newer (lighter) types of laser photocoagulation may also work better than standard laser. Studies of these newer types of laser are ongoing. What was studied in the review?   Diabetes is a condition where a person's blood sugar is too high. Some people with diabetes may develop problems with their eyes due to diabetic retinopathy. This is because diabetes affects the small blood vessels at the back of the eye (retina). People with diabetic retinopathy can develop swelling in the central part of the back of eye: this is known as diabetic macular oedema. It is important to treat diabetic macular oedema because it can lead to vision loss. Eye doctors can treat the back of the eye with small laser burns with the aim of reducing the chance of vision loss from diabetic macular oedema. This is known as laser photocoagulation. In newer types of laser photocoagulation, known as subthreshold, the laser burns are applied using less energy and potentially cause less damage. Different types of laser can be used. The main types of laser are argon or diode laser. What are the main results of the review?   Cochrane researchers found 24 relevant studies. Nine of these studies were from Europe, seven from the USA and four from Asia. The rest were from Africa, Australia, South America, and one study took place in Europe and Asia. Some of these studies compared laser photocoagulation with no photocoagulation for people with diabetic macular oedema. Other studies compared different intensity of la er, for example, comparing subthreshold laser with standard laser. Other studies compared different types of laser (mainly argon and diode). Cochrane researchers assessed how certain the evidence was for each review finding. They looked for factors that could make the evidence less certain, such as problems with the way the studies were done, very small studies and inconsistent findings across studies. They also looked for factors that could make the evidence more certain, including very large effects. They graded each finding as very low‐, low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty. The review showed that: • people with diabetic macular oedema who received laser were less likely to lose vision compared with no laser over one to three years (moderate‐certainty evidence). They were also more likely to have improvements in signs of diabetic macular oedema at the back of the eye;  • low‐certainty evidence suggested that subthreshold laser may be similar, or possibly better than standard laser. Studies of subthreshold laser are currently ongoing;  • there was no clear evidence of any difference between the different types of laser (in particular argon and diode);  • there were no important adverse effects after laser treatment. How up‐to‐date is this review?   Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 24 July 2018.	10.1002/14651858.CD010859.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	490	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010859.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Giordano, A.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Patient Education as Topic  Consumer Health Information  Decision Making  Humans  Multiple Sclerosis [diagnosis, *therapy]  Quality of Life  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with a number of important uncertainties concerning many aspects of the disease. These include diagnosis, prognosis, disease course, disease‐modifying therapies, symptomatic therapies, and non‐pharmacological interventions, among others. While people with MS demand adequate information to be able to actively participate in medical decision making and to self manage their disease, it has been shown that patients’ disease‐related knowledge is poor, therefore guidelines recommend clear and concise high‐quality information at all stages of the disease. Several studies have outlined communication and information deficits in the care of people with MS. However, only a few information and decision support programmes have been published. Objectives The primary objectives of this updated review was to evaluate the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS that aim to promote informed choice and improve patient‐relevant outcomes, Further objectives were to evaluate the components and the developmental processes of the complex interventions used, to highlight the quantity and the certainty of the research evidence available, and to set an agenda for future research. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register, which contains trials from CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and clinical trials registries (29 November 2017) as well as other sources. We also searched reference lists of identified articles and contacted trialists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised controlled trials, and quasi‐randomised trials comparing information provision for people with MS or suspected MS (intervention groups) with usual care or other types of information provision (control groups) were eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias. We contacted authors of relevant studies for additional information. Main results We identified one new RCT (73 participants), which when added to the 10 previously included RCTs resulted in a total of 11 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (1387 participants overall; mean age, range: 31 to 51; percentage women, range: 63% to 100%; percentage relapsing‐remitting MS course, range: 45% to 100%). The interventions addressed a variety of topics using different approaches for information provision in different settings. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. The active intervention components included decision aids, decision coaching, educational programmes, self care programmes, and personal interviews with physicians. All studies used one or more components, but the number and extent differed markedly between studies. The studies had a variable risk of bias. We did not perform meta‐analyses due to marked clinical heterogeneity. All five studies assessing MS‐related knowledge (505 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) detected significant differences between groups as a result of the interventions, indicating that information provision may successfully increase participants’ knowledge. There were mixed results on decision making (five studies, 793 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and quality of life (six studies, 671 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were detected in the seven studies reporting this outcome. Authors' conclusions Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease‐related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life. The included st dies in this review reported no negative side effects of providing disease‐related information to people with MS. Interpretation of study results remains challenging due to the marked heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures. Plain language summary Information provision to help people with multiple sclerosis make informed decisions Background People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with many uncertainties in all phases of the disease. For example, the significance of a diagnosis for the future disease course remains unclear, as up to one‐third of people will experience a benign disease course with little or even no disability progression. Uncertainty is also present for the effects and adverse effects of drug and non‐drug therapies. People with MS have the right and wish to receive accurate, recent, and relevant information in order to make informed choices on all relevant disease‐related decisions and also on personal life‐planning decisions. For this to occur, balanced information is a prerequisite. It has been shown that disease knowledge is poor in people with MS, therefore people with MS should receive interventions that provide information on all aspects relevant for them. Results We searched for relevant studies in the medical literature in November 2017 and identified 11 studies involving a total of 1387 participants. The studies evaluated a variety of approaches including the provision of written information or decision aids, coaching, educational programmes, and personal information. The quality of the study methods varied. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. Five studies assessing level of knowledge showed that information may successfully increase patients’ knowledge (moderate‐certainty evidence). Five studies reporting on the effects on decision making (low‐certainty evidence) and six studies assessing quality of life (low‐certainty evidence) showed mixed results. As the studies and the interventions used differed markedly, and the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes was not high, our results prevented a clear conclusion about the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS.	10.1002/14651858.CD008757.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	485	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008757.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Very early versus delayed mobilisation after stroke	Langhorne PC, J. M.  Bate, P. J.  Thuy, M. N. T.  Bernhardt, J.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Early Ambulation  *Stroke Rehabilitation  Humans  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic  Time Factors	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Very early mobilisation (VEM) is performed in some stroke units and recommended in some acute stroke clinical guidelines. However, it is unclear whether very early mobilisation independently improves outcome after stroke. Objectives To determine whether very early mobilisation (started as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after onset of symptoms) in people with acute stroke improves recovery (primarily the proportion of independent survivors) compared with usual care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 31 July 2017). We also systematically searched 19 electronic databases including; CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 7 in the Cochrane Library (searched July 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to August 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to August 2017), CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to August 2017) , PsycINFO Ovid (1806 to August 2017), AMED Ovid (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), SPORTDiscus EBSCO (1830 to August 2017). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched December 2016), the Chinese medical database, Wanfangdata (searched to November 2016), and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with acute stroke, comparing an intervention group that started out‐of‐bed mobilisation within 48 hours of stroke, and aimed to reduce time‐to‐first mobilisation, with or without an increase in the amount or frequency (or both) of mobilisation activities, with usual care, where time‐to‐first mobilisation was commenced later. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was death or poor outcome (dependency or institutionalisation) at the end of scheduled follow‐up. Secondary outcomes included death, dependency, institutionalisation, activities of daily living (ADL), extended ADL, quality of life, walking ability, complications (e.g. deep vein thrombosis), patient mood, and length of hospital stay. We also analysed outcomes at three‐month follow‐up. Main results We included nine RCTs with 2958 participants; one trial provided most of the information (2104 participants). The median (range) delay to starting mobilisation after stroke onset was 18.5 (13.1 to 43) hours in the VEM group and 33.3 (22.5 to 71.5) hours in the usual care group. The median difference within trials was 12.7 (4 to 45.6) hours. Other differences in intervention varied between trials; in five trials, the VEM group were also reported to have received more time in therapy, or more mobilisation activity. Primary outcome data were available for 2542 of 2618 (97.1%) participants randomized and followed up for a median of three months. VEM probably led to similar or slightly more deaths and participants who had a poor outcome, compared with delayed mobilisation (51% versus 49%; odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.26; P = 0.36; 8 trials; moderate‐quality evidence). Death occurred in 7% of participants who received delayed mobilisation, and 8.5% of participants who received VEM (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.70; P = 0.11; 8 trials, 2570 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and the effects on experiencing any complication were unclear (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; P = 0.18; 7 trials, 2778 participants; low‐quality evidence). Analysis using outcomes collected only at three‐month follow‐up did not alter the conclusions. The mean ADL score (measured at end of follow‐up, with the 20‐point Barthel Index) was higher in those who received VEM compared with the usual care group (mean difference (MD) 1.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.13, P = 0.001; 8 trials, 9 comparisons, 2630/2904 participants (90.6%); low‐quality evidence), but there was substantial heterogeneity (93%). Effect sizes were smaller for outcomes collected at three‐month follow‐up, rath r than later. The mean length of stay was shorter in those who received VEM compared with the usual care group (MD ‐1.44, 95% CI ‐2.28 to ‐0.60, P = 0.0008; 8 trials, 2532/2618 participants (96.7%); low‐quality evidence). Confidence in the answer was limited by the variable definitions of length of stay. The other secondary outcome analyses (institutionalisation, extended activities of daily living, quality of life, walking ability, patient mood) were limited by lack of data. Sensitivity analyses by trial quality: none of the outcome conclusions were altered if we restricted analyses to trials with the lowest risk of bias (based on method of randomization, allocation concealment, completeness of follow‐up, and blinding of final assessment), or information about the amount of mobilisation. Sensitivity analysis by intervention characteristics: analyses restricted to trials where the mean VEM time‐to‐first mobilisation was less than 24 hours, showed an odds of death of 1.35 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.83; P = 0.06; I² = 25%; 5 trials). Analyses restricted to the trials that clearly reported a more prolonged out‐of‐bed activity showed a similar primary outcome (OR 1.14; 0.96 to 1.35; P = 0.13; I² = 28%; 5 trials), and odds of death (OR 1.27; 0.93 to 1.73; P = 0.13; I² = 0%; 4 trials) to the main analysis. Exploratory network meta‐analysis (NMA): we were unable to analyze by the amount of therapy, but low‐quality evidence indicated that time‐to‐first mobilisation at around 24 hours was associated with the lowest odds of death or poor outcome, compared with earlier or later mobilisation. Authors' conclusions VEM, which usually involved first mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke onset, did not increase the number of people who survived or made a good recovery after their stroke. VEM may have reduced the length of stay in hospital by about one day, but this was based on low‐quality evidence. Based on the potential hazards reported in the single largest RCT, the sensitivity analysis of trials commencing mobilisation within 24 hours, and the NMA, there was concern that VEM commencing within 24 hours may carry an increased risk, at least in some people with stroke. Given the uncertainty around these effect estimates, more detailed research is still required. Plain language summary Very early versus delayed mobilisation after stroke Review question   Does very early and active mobilisation improve recovery after stroke compared with more delayed mobilisation? Background   Care in a stroke unit is recommended for people soon after a stroke, and results in an improved chance of surviving, returning home, and regaining independence. Very early mobilisation (helping people to get up out of bed very early, and more often after the onset of stroke symptoms) is performed in some stroke units, and is recommended in many acute stroke clinical guidelines. However, the impact of very early mobilisation on recovery after stroke is not clear. Search date   This review is up‐to‐date to July 2017. Study characteristics   This review identified nine trials (2958 participants), although one trial (2104 participants) provided most of the information. On average, very early mobilisation participants started mobilisation 18.5 hours after their stroke, compared with 33.3 hours in the usual care group. In five trials, the very early mobilisation group were also known to have spent more time per day in therapy, or participated in a mobilisation activity. Main results   Very early mobilisation did not increase the number of people who survived or made a good recovery after their stroke. There was a suggestion that very early mobilisation may reduce the length of stay in hospital by about one day. However, results from the single largest trial, and from an analysis of trials that started mobilising participants very early, raised the concern that starting intensive mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke may carry some increased risk, at least for some people with stroke. This potential risk needs to be clarified. Quality of the evidence   Overall, the main results were supported by moderate‐quality evidence overall, but low‐quality evidence backed length of hospital stay and activities of daily living.	10.1002/14651858.CD006187.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	486	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006187.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Improving communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and their carers may alleviate these disorders. Communication may include information or educational interventions, in different formats, aiming to improve knowledge of the prognosis, treatment, or anticipated challenges after ICU discharge. Objectives To assess the effects of information or education interventions for improving outcomes in adult ICU patients and their carers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from database inception to 10 April 2017. We searched clinical trials registries and grey literature, and handsearched reference lists of included studies and related reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and planned to include quasi‐RCTs, comparing information or education interventions presented to participants versus no information or education interventions, or comparing information or education interventions as part of a complex intervention versus a complex intervention without information or education. We included participants who were adult ICU patients, or their carers; these included relatives and non‐relatives, including significant representatives of patients. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied GRADE criteria to assess certainty of the evidence. Main results We included eight RCTs with 1157 patient participants and 943 carer participants. We found no quasi‐RCTs. We identified seven studies that await classification, and three ongoing studies. Three studies designed an intervention targeted at patients, four at carers, and one at both patients and carers. Studies included varied information: standardised or tailored, presented once or several times, and that included verbal or written information, audio recordings, multimedia information, and interactive information packs. Five studies reported robust methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. We noted high attrition rates in five studies. It was not feasible to blind participants, and we rated all studies as at high risk of performance bias, and at unclear risk of detection bias because most outcomes required self reporting. We attempted to pool data statistically, however this was not always possible due to high levels of heterogeneity. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using data reported from individual study authors where possible, and narratively synthesised the results. We reported the following two comparisons. Information or education intervention versus no information or education intervention (4 studies) For patient anxiety, we did not pool data from three studies (332 participants) owing to unexplained substantial statistical heterogeneity and possible clinical or methodological differences between studies. One study reported less anxiety when an intervention was used (MD ‐3.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.38 to ‐3.02), and two studies reported little or no difference between groups (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐4.75 to 3.95; MD ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐2.94 to 0.94). Similarly, for patient depression, we did not pool data from two studies (160 patient participants). These studies reported less depression when an information or education intervention was used (MD ‐2.90, 95% CI ‐4.00 to ‐1.80; MD ‐1.27, 95% CI ‐1.47 to ‐1.07). However, it is uncertain whether information or education interventions reduce patient anxiety or depression due to very low‐certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether information or education interventions improve health‐related quality of life due to very low‐certainty evidence from one study reporting little or no dif erence between intervention groups (MD ‐1.30, 95% CI ‐4.99 to 2.39; 143 patient participants). No study reported adverse effects, knowledge acquisition, PTSD severity, or patient or carer satisfaction. We used the GRADE approach and downgraded certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations, inconsistencies between results, and limited data from few small studies. Information or education intervention as part of a complex intervention versus a complex intervention without information or education (4 studies) One study (three comparison groups; 38 participants) reported little or no difference between groups in patient anxiety (tailored information pack versus control: MD 0.09, 95% CI ‐3.29 to 3.47; standardised general ICU information versus control: MD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐4.34 to 3.84), and little or no difference in patient depression (tailored information pack versus control: MD ‐1.26, 95% CI ‐4.48 to 1.96; standardised general ICU information versus control: MD ‐1.47, 95% CI ‐6.37 to 3.43). It is uncertain whether information or education interventions as part of a complex intervention reduce patient anxiety and depression due to very low‐certainty evidence. One study (175 carer participants) reported fewer carer participants with poor comprehension among those given information (risk ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53), but again this finding is uncertain due to very low‐certainty evidence. Two studies (487 carer participants) reported little or no difference in carer satisfaction; it is uncertain whether information or education interventions as part of a complex intervention increase carer satisfaction due to very low‐certainty evidence. Adverse effects were reported in only one study: one participant withdrew because of deterioration in mental health on completion of anxiety and depression questionnaires, but the study authors did not report whether this participant was from the intervention or comparison group. We downgraded certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations, and limited data from few small studies. No studies reported severity of PTSD, or health‐related quality of life. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain of the effects of information or education interventions given to adult ICU patients and their carers, as the evidence in all cases was of very low certainty, and our confidence in the evidence was limited. Ongoing studies may contribute more data and introduce more certainty when incorporated into future updates of the review. Plain language summary Information for adult intensive care unit patients and their carers Background During intensive care unit (ICU) admission, patients and their carers experience physical and psychological stressors that may lead to increased anxiety, depression, and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Improving communication among patients, their carers, and doctors, nurses, and other ICU staff may improve these outcomes. Communication may include information or educational interventions, in different formats, which aim to improve knowledge of the patient's condition, their treatment plan, or challenges they may face after ICU discharge. Study characteristics The evidence is current up to 10 April 2017. We included eight studies with 1157 ICU patients and 943 carers of ICU patients. Seven studies are awaiting classification because we could not assess their eligibility, and three studies are ongoing. We included studies that assessed information given to patients or their carers compared to no information, and studies that assessed information as part of a more complex intervention compared to a complex intervention that did not include information or education. Studies included varied information: standardised or tailored to the individual, given regularly or on a single occasion, and that included verbal or written information, audio recordings, multimedia information, and interactive information packs. Key results Overall, it is uncertain whether information or education (given alone or as part of a more complex intervention) impr ves outcomes for patients and their carers following a stay in the ICU. For patients, it is uncertain whether or not information or education reduces anxiety or depression, or improves health‐related quality of life. One patient asked to withdraw from the study because they believed that their mental health worsened when they completed a questionnaire to assess anxiety and depression, but it is not clear whether this person received the information intervention or not. No studies reported PTSD in patients. For carers, it is uncertain whether or not information or education reduces anxiety or depression or improves carers' knowledge acquisition or their satisfaction with information provided. Quality of the evidence It was not possible for researchers to mask patients and carers to the intervention they received, and it was unclear whether this would affect the results, which relied on self assessments. Study authors did not consistently report rigorous methods for carrying out randomised trials, and we noted some losses of patients and carers during the studies. We found few small studies for this review, reporting limited data for many outcomes of interest. It is uncertain whether information or education is effective due to very low‐certainty evidence. Conclusion We are uncertain about the effects of information or education interventions given to adult ICU patients and their carers. The evidence was of very low certainty, and our confidence in the evidence was limited. We are aware of three ongoing studies and seven studies that were recently completed but not yet published. These studies may provide additional evidence or improve the certainty in the findings in future updates of the review.	10.1002/14651858.CD012471.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	488	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012471.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Percutaneous vascular interventions versus intravenous thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke	Lindekleiv HB, E.  Bruins Slot, K. M. H.  Wardlaw, J. M.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Most ischaemic strokes are caused by blockage of a cerebral artery by a thrombus. Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator given within 4.5 hours is now standard treatment for this condition. Percutaneous vascular interventions use an intra‐arterial, mechanical approach for thrombus disruption or removal (thrombectomy). Recent randomised trials indicate that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to usual care (usual care usually included intravenous thrombolysis). However, intravenous thrombolysis was usually given in both arms of the trial and there was a lack of direct comparison of percutaneous vascular interventions with intravenous thrombolysis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vascular interventions compared with intravenous thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last search: August 2018). In addition, in September 2017, we searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index; and Stroke Trials Registry, and US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared a percutaneous vascular intervention with intravenous thrombolytic treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained both published and unpublished data. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included four trials with 450 participants. Data on functional outcome and death at end of follow‐up were available for 443 participants from three trials. Compared with intravenous thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.25, P = 0.92). The quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). At the end of follow‐up, there was a non‐significant increase in the proportion of participants who died in the percutaneous vascular intervention group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.14, P = 0.21). The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval). There was no difference in the proportion of participants with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.95, P = 0.97). The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval). Data on vascular status (recanalisation rate) were only available for seven participants from one trial; we considered this inadequate for statistical analyses. Authors' conclusions The present review directly compared intravenous thrombolytic treatment with percutaneous vascular interventions for ischaemic stroke. We found no evidence from RCTs that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to intravenous thrombolytic treatment with respect to functional outcome. Quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). New trials with adequate sample sizes are warranted because of the rapid development of new techniques and devices for such interventions. Plain language summary Treatments through the artery versus clot‐dissolving drugs for the early treatment of stroke Review question Are there differences in the safety and effectiveness of treatments delivered into the blocked artery (percutaneous vascular interventions) and clot‐dissolving drugs (intravenous thrombolysis) in the early treatment of stroke. Background Most strokes are caused by a blockage of an artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt treatment with clot‐dissolving drugs (thrombolysis) can restore blood flow and prevent brain damage. The development of treatments delivered through a tube into the artery (percutaneous vascular interventions) has led to new possibilities in the treatment of stroke. This approach gives direct access to the blood clot, which can be mechanically removed or dissolved. Despite widespread use of these treatments it is unclear whether they are more effective and safe than clot‐dissolving drugs given by injection (intravenous thrombolysis). Study characteristics We included four trials with 450 participants randomised to either percutaneous vascular intervention or clot‐dissolving drugs given by injection. Search date The evidence is current as of September 2017. Key results Compared with clot‐dissolving drugs, percutaneous vascular interventions did not increase the chance of making a good recovery by the end of the trial. There was no significant increase in the risk of dying or of suffering a brain bleed. New, larger trials are needed, particularly because of the rapid development of new techniques and devices for percutaneous vascular interventions. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be low because of the limited amount of trial information available.	10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	520	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross‐checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This review provides moderate‐quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well‐designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole. Plain language summary Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke Question : Are GABA receptor agonist drugs effective and safe in the treatment of acute stroke?    Background : GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke.    Study characteristics : We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was gene ally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately.    Key results : All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation.    Quality of the evidence : In conclusion, moderate‐quality evidence did not support the use of GABA receptor agonists for the treatment of people with acute stroke.	10.1002/14651858.CD009622.pub5	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	498	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009622.pub5	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus	Liu ZD, J. C.  Hinchliffe, R. J.  Cullum, N.  Game, F.  Stubbs, N.  Sweeting, M.  Peinemann, F.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Amputation  *Bandages  *Wound Healing  Debridement  Diabetic Foot [*surgery]  Humans  Negative‐Pressure Wound Therapy [adverse effects, *methods]  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding its use. Objectives To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. Search methods In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. Main results Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing. NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative wounds Two studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow‐up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcers There were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow‐up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the numb r of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Low‐pressure compared with high‐pressure NPWT for foot ulcers One study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg. Follow‐up time was four weeks. There were no data on primary outcomes. There was no clear difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery between groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision) and adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.04; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision). Authors' conclusions There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT, when compared with wound dressings, may increase the proportion of wounds healed and reduce the time to healing for postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with DM. For the comparisons of different pressures of NPWT for treating foot ulcers in people with DM, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and adverse events. None of the included studies provided evidence on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making regarding the use of NPWT to treat foot wounds in people with DM. Plain language summary Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus What was the aim of this review? We reviewed the evidence about whether or not negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is effective in treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) to answer this question and found 11 relevant studies. Key messages We cannot be certain whether NPWT is effective for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. There is some low‐certainty evidence that NPWT increases the number of wounds healed compared with dressings, and may reduce the time it takes wounds to heal. We are uncertain about the effectiveness of different pressures of NPWT on wound healing. Overall, the reliability of the evidence provided by the trials is too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of NPWT for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. What did the review study? Diabetes mellitus is a common condition that leads to high blood glucose (blood sugar) concentrations, with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Some people with diabetes can develop ulcers on their feet. These wounds can take a long time to heal, they can be painful and become infected. Ulceration of the foot in people with diabetes can also lead to a higher risk of amputation of parts of the foot or leg. Generally, people with diabetes are at a higher risk of lower‐limb amputation than people without diabetes. NPWT is a treatment currently being used for wounds including leg ulcers. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine which sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the tr ated area into a canister. Worldwide, the use of NPWT is increasing. However, it is expensive compared with wound treatments such as dressings. We wanted to find out if NPWT could help foot wounds in people with diabetes to heal more quickly and effectively. We wanted to know if people treated with NPWT experienced any side effects. We were also interested in the impact of NPWT on people's quality of life. What were the main results of the review? In January 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared NPWT with other treatments for foot ulcers or other open wounds of the foot in people with diabetes. We found 11 trials involving 972 adults. Participant numbers in each trial ranged from 15 to 341 and trial follow‐up (observation) times ranged from four weeks to 16 weeks where specified. Not all the studies stated how they were funded. Two were funded by an NPWT manufacturer. There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT may be effective in healing postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with diabetes compared with wound dressings, in terms of the proportion of wounds healed and time to healing. For the comparison of different pressures of NPWT for foot ulcers in people with diabetes, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and side effects. There was no evidence available on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. How up to date was this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to January 2018.	10.1002/14651858.CD010318.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	476	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010318.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Individual‐, family‐, and school‐level interventions targeting multiple risk behaviours in young people	MacArthur GC, D. M.  Redmore, J.  Watkins, S. H.  Kipping, R.  White, J.  Chittleborough, C.  Langford, R.  Er, V.  Lingam, R.  et al.,	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Engagement in multiple risk behaviours can have adverse consequences for health during childhood, during adolescence, and later in life, yet little is known about the impact of different types of interventions that target multiple risk behaviours in children and young people, or the differential impact of universal versus targeted approaches. Findings from systematic reviews have been mixed, and effects of these interventions have not been quantitatively estimated. Objectives To examine the effects of interventions implemented up to 18 years of age for the primary or secondary prevention of multiple risk behaviours among young people. Search methods We searched 11 databases (Australian Education Index; British Education Index; Campbell Library; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; Embase; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; and Sociological Abstracts) on three occasions (2012, 2015, and 14 November 2016)). We conducted handsearches of reference lists, contacted experts in the field, conducted citation searches, and searched websites of relevant organisations. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs, which aimed to address at least two risk behaviours. Participants were children and young people up to 18 years of age and/or parents, guardians, or carers, as long as the intervention aimed to address involvement in multiple risk behaviours among children and young people up to 18 years of age. However, studies could include outcome data on children > 18 years of age at the time of follow‐up. Specifically,we included studies with outcomes collected from those eight to 25 years of age. Further, we included only studies with a combined intervention and follow‐up period of six months or longer. We excluded interventions aimed at individuals with clinically diagnosed disorders along with clinical interventions. We categorised interventions according to whether they were conducted at the individual level; the family level; or the school level. Data collection and analysis We identified a total of 34,680 titles, screened 27,691 articles and assessed 424 full‐text articles for eligibility. Two or more review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data in meta‐analyses using a random‐effects (DerSimonian and Laird) model in RevMan 5.3. For each outcome, we included subgroups related to study type (individual, family, or school level, and universal or targeted approach) and examined effectiveness at up to 12 months' follow‐up and over the longer term (> 12 months). We assessed the quality and certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results We included in the review a total of 70 eligible studies, of which a substantial proportion were universal school‐based studies (n = 28; 40%). Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 55; 79%). On average, studies aimed to prevent four of the primary behaviours. Behaviours that were most frequently addressed included alcohol use (n = 55), drug use (n = 53), and/or antisocial behaviour (n = 53), followed by tobacco use (n = 42). No studies aimed to prevent self‐harm or gambling alongside other behaviours. Evidence suggests that for multiple risk behaviours, universal school‐based interventions were beneficial in relation to tobacco use (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.97; n = 9 studies; 15,354 participants) and alcohol use (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92; n = 8 studies; 8751 participants; both moderate‐quality evidence) compared to a comparator, and that such interventions may be effective in preventing illicit drug use (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; n = 5 studies; 11,058 participants; low‐quality evidence) and engagement in any antisocial behaviour (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; n = 13 studies; 20,756 participants; very low‐quality evidence) at up to 12 months' follow‐up, although there was evidence of moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 49% to 69%). Moderate‐quality evidence also showed that multiple risk behaviour universal school‐based interventions improved the odds of physical activity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.50; I² = 0%; n = 4 studies; 6441 participants). We considered observed effects to be of public health importance when applied at the population level. Evidence was less certain for the effects of such multiple risk behaviour interventions for cannabis use (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01; P = 0.06; n = 5 studies; 4140 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence), sexual risk behaviours (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12; P = 0.22; n = 6 studies; 12,633 participants; I² = 77%; low‐quality evidence), and unhealthy diet (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.06; P = 0.13; n = 3 studies; 6441 participants; I² = 49%; moderate‐quality evidence). It is important to note that some evidence supported the positive effects of universal school‐level interventions on three or more risk behaviours. For most outcomes of individual‐ and family‐level targeted and universal interventions, moderate‐ or low‐quality evidence suggests little or no effect, although caution is warranted in interpretation because few of these studies were available for comparison (n ≤ 4 studies for each outcome). Seven studies reported adverse effects, which involved evidence suggestive of increased involvement in a risk behaviour among participants receiving the intervention compared to participants given control interventions. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate or low for most outcomes, primarily owing to concerns around selection, performance, and detection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Authors' conclusions Available evidence is strongest for universal school‐based interventions that target multiple‐ risk behaviours, demonstrating that they may be effective in preventing engagement in tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and antisocial behaviour, and in improving physical activity among young people, but not in preventing other risk behaviours. Results of this review do not provide strong evidence of benefit for family‐ or individual‐level interventions across the risk behaviours studied. However, poor reporting and concerns around the quality of evidence highlight the need for high‐quality multiple‐ risk behaviour intervention studies to further strengthen the evidence base in this field. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing multiple risk behaviours in young people Background Health risk behaviours, such as smoking and drug use, can group together during the teenage years, and engagement in these multiple risk behaviours can lead to health problems such as injury and substance abuse during childhood and adolescence, as well as non‐communicable diseases later in life. Currently, we do not know which interventions are effective in preventing or decreasing these risky behaviours among children and young people. Search methods and selection of studies We carried out thorough searches of multiple scientific databases to identify studies that looked at ways of preventing or decreasing engagement in two or more risk behaviours, including tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, gambling, self‐harm, sexual risk behaviour, antisocial behaviour, vehicle‐risk behaviour, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition, among young people aged eight to 25 years. We divided these studies into groups (individual‐level, family‐level, and school‐level studies) according to whether researchers worked with individuals, families, or children and young people in schools, respectively. We specifically looked at "gold standard" studies ‐ randomised controlled trials that aimed to examine two or more behaviours of interest. Main results In total, 70 studies were eligible for inclusion in this rev ew. Half included populations without any consideration for risk status, and half focused on higher‐risk groups. Most were conducted in the USA or in high‐income countries. On average, studies examined the effects of interventions on four behaviours, most commonly alcohol, tobacco use, drug use, and antisocial behaviour. We found that for multiple risk behaviours, school‐based studies for all young people are more beneficial than a comparator for preventing tobacco use, alcohol use, and physical inactivity, and that they may also be beneficial in relation to illicit drug use and antisocial behaviour. Findings were weaker for cannabis use, sexual risk behaviour, and unhealthy diet. Evidence suggests that certain school‐based programmes could have a beneficial impact on more than one behaviour. In contrast, we did not find strong evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for families or individuals for the behaviours of interest, although caution must be applied in interpreting these findings because we identified fewer of these studies. Last, we found seven studies that reported increased levels of engagement in risk behaviours among those receiving the intervention compared to those given the control. Overall, reviewers judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate or low for most behaviours examined using standardised criteria, with one behaviour found to have very low quality evidence. In part, this was due to concerns around how some studies were conducted, which could have introduced bias. Conclusions Our findings suggest that school‐based interventions offered to all children that aim to address engagement in multiple risk behaviours may have a role to play in preventing tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and antisocial behaviour, as well as in improving physical activity, among young people, but not in the other behaviours examined. We did not find strong evidence of benefit of interventions for families or individuals. Concerns around reporting of studies and study quality highlight the need for additional robust, high‐quality studies to further strengthen the evidence base in this field.	10.1002/14651858.CD009927.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	471	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009927.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Special support surfaces (including beds, mattresses and cushions) designed to redistribute pressure, are widely used as treatments. The relative effects of different support surfaces are unclear. This is an update of an existing review. Objectives To assess the effects of pressure‐relieving support surfaces in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Search methods In September 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria We included published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), that assessed the effects of support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers, in any participant group or setting. Data collection and analysis Data extraction, assessment of 'Risk of bias' and GRADE assessments were performed independently by two review authors. Trials with similar participants, comparisons and outcomes were considered for meta‐analysis. Where meta‐analysis was inappropriate, we reported the results of the trials narratively. Where possible, we planned to report data as either risk ratio or mean difference as appropriate. Main results For this update we identified one new trial of support surfaces for pressure ulcer treatment, bringing the total to 19 trials involving 3241 participants. Most trials were small, with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 1971, and were generally at high or unclear risk of bias. Primary outcome: healing of existing pressure ulcers Low‐tech constant pressure support surfaces It is uncertain whether profiling beds increase the proportion of pressure ulcer which heal compared with standard hospital beds as the evidence is of very low certainty: (RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.28 to 12.24), downgraded for serious risk of bias, serious imprecision and indirectness (1 study; 70 participants). There is currently no clear difference in ulcer healing between water‐filled support surfaces and foam replacement mattresses: (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.37); low‐certainty evidence downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (1 study; 120 participants). Further analysis could not be performed for polyester overlays versus gel overlays (1 study; 72 participants), non‐powered mattresses versus low‐air‐loss mattresses (1 study; 20 participants) or standard hospital mattresses with sheepskin overlays versus standard hospital mattresses (1 study; 36 participants). High‐tech pressure support surfaces It is currently unclear whether high‐tech pressure support surfaces (such as low‐air‐loss beds, air suspension beds, and alternating pressure surfaces) improve the healing of pressure ulcers (14 studies; 2923 participants) or which intervention may be more effective. The certainty of the evidence is generally low, downgraded mostly for risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. Secondary outcomes No analyses were undertaken with respect to secondary outcomes including participant comfort and surface reliability and acceptability as reporting of these within the included trials was very limited. Overall, the evidence is of low to very low certainty and was primarily downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision with some indirectness. Authors' conclusions Based on the current evidence, it is unclear whether any particular type of low‐ or high‐tech support surface is more effective at healing pressure ulcers than standard support surfaces. Plain language summary Support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was t find out whether different support surfaces such as specially‐designed beds, mattresses or cushions can help to treat pressure ulcers. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question, and found 19 relevant studies. Key messages We cannot be certain which support surfaces are most effective for pressure ulcer treatment as the studies comparing them did not involve enough people and were not well designed. What was studied in the review? Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by pressure or rubbing. They typically form at points on the body which are bony or which bear weight or pressure, such as the hips, buttocks, heels and elbows. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. A range of treatments, including wound dressings and support surfaces like special mattresses and cushions, are used to treat pressure ulcers. Support surfaces for pressure ulcer treatment can include specially‐designed beds, mattresses, mattress overlays and cushions that are used to protect vulnerable parts of the body and distribute the surface pressure more evenly. Low‐tech support surfaces include mattresses filled with foam, fluid, beads or air; and alternative foam mattresses and overlays. High‐tech support surfaces include mattresses and overlays that are electrically powered to alternate the pressure within the surface, beds that are powered to have air mechanically circulated within them and low‐air‐loss beds that contain warm air moving within pockets inside the bed. Other support surfaces include sheepskins, cushions and operating table overlays. We wanted to find out which support surfaces were most effective in helping pressure ulcers to heal. We also wanted to compare different support surfaces in terms of cost, reliability, durability, and the benefits or harms for patients using them. What are the main results of the review? In September 2017, we searched for trials looking at support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers and which reported their effects on wound healing. We found 19 trials involving 3241 participants, all adults, the majority of whom were older people and bed‐bound in hospitals or nursing homes. In studies where participants' sex was reported, the majority were women. Not all studies reported their funding sources, but two of those who did were funded by device manufacturers. Five studies involving 318 participants compared low‐tech constant low‐pressure (CLP) support surfaces such as foam mattresses. We cannot be certain how these different support surfaces affect pressure ulcer healing as the evidence is mainly of low certainty. Fourteen studies involving 2923 participants compared different high‐tech support surfaces such as air‐fluidised beds. Again, we cannot be certain how these different support surfaces affect ulcer healing rates as the certainty of the evidence is mainly low. We are not able to draw firm conclusions about the effects of different support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers because the overall quality of the evidence is low to very low. Many of the studies included only small numbers of people, did not provide adequate information on their results, or were not well designed. Further, better conducted trials are necessary to determine which support surfaces are most effective in treating pressure ulcers. How up to date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to September 2017.	10.1002/14651858.CD009490.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	501	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009490.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

It is unclear whether newborn infants may benefit from this therapy and whether naloxone has any harmful effects. Objectives To determine the effect of naloxone on the need for and duration of neonatal unit stay in infants of mothers who received opioid analgesia prior to delivery or of mothers who have used a prescribed or non‐prescribed opioid during pregnancy. Search methods We searched the following databases in February 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCO), Maternity and Infant Care (OvidSP), and PubMed. We searched for ongoing and completed trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the EU Clinical Trials Register. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify further potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing the administration of naloxone versus placebo, or no drug, or another dose of naloxone to newborn infants with suspected or confirmed in utero exposure to opioid. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors and synthesis of data using risk ratio, risk difference, and mean difference. Main results We included nine trials, with 316 participants in total, that compared the effects of naloxone versus placebo or no drug in newborn infants exposed to maternal opioid analgesia prior to delivery. None of the included trials investigated infants born to mothers who had used a prescribed or non‐prescribed opioid during pregnancy. None of these trials specifically recruited infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression. The main outcomes reported were measures of respiratory function in the first six hours after birth. There is some evidence that naloxone increases alveolar ventilation. The trials did not assess the effect on the primary outcomes of this review (admission to a neonatal unit and failure to establish breastfeeding). Authors' conclusions The existing evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to determine whether naloxone confers any important benefits to newborn infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression that may be due to intrauterine exposure to opioid. Given concerns about the safety of naloxone in this context, it may be appropriate to limit its use to randomised controlled trials that aim to resolve these uncertainties. Plain language summary Naloxone for opioid‐exposed newborn infants Review question Does naloxone (a drug that counters the negative effects of opioids on breathing) help newborn babies whose mothers have received opioid pain relief during birth? Background When a woman receives opioid medicines for pain relief during labour (for example, pethidine, morphine, and similar drugs), the opioid can cross over to the baby inside the womb and then reduce the newborn baby's breathing rate. Naloxone, a drug that counters the effects of opioids, can be given to the newborn baby to try to prevent or treat problems with breathing. This may reduce the chance of the baby needing to go to a neonatal unit for help with breathing, and reduce the need for separating mother and baby (and so help with establishing breastfeeding). Concern exists, however, that naloxone may cause side effects, including possible long‐term developmental problems. Study characteristics We found nine completed trials that compared giving to newborn babies, whose mothers had received opioids during labour, either naloxone or a placebo ('dummy drug'). These trials were conducted more than 30 years ago and they were generally very small including only about 300 infants in tota . Most of the trials did not use reliable methods consistently. Evidence is up‐to‐date as of February 2018. Key results The trials reported the effects of naloxone on the baby's breathing but did not assess the effect on the need for babies to be cared for in a neonatal unit (separated from their mother), whether they needed help with breathing, or on breastfeeding success. None of the trials assessed long‐term development. We did not find any trials including babies born to mothers who had used opioids (whether prescribed or non‐prescribed) during pregnancy. Quality of evidence The available evidence was not sufficient to determine whether giving naloxone to babies whose mothers received opioids during birth was helpful or harmful.	10.1002/14651858.CD003483.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	496	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003483.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Heliox for croup in children	Moraa IS, N.  McGuire, T. M.  van Driel, M. L.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	Adrenal Cortex Hormones [therapeutic use]  Airway Obstruction [etiology, *therapy]  Airway Resistance [drug effects]  Bronchodilator Agents [therapeutic use]  Child, Preschool  Croup [*complications]  Dexamethasone [therapeutic use]  Epinephrine [therapeutic use]  Helium [*administration & dosage]  Humans  Infant  Oxygen Inhalation Therapy [methods]  Oxygen [*administration & dosage]  Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Croup is an acute viral respiratory infection with upper airway mucosal inflammation that may cause respiratory distress. Most cases are mild. Moderate to severe croup may require treatment with corticosteroids (from which benefits are often delayed) and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) (which may be short‐lived and can cause dose‐related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension). Rarely, croup results in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation. A mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates by reducing the viscosity of the inhaled air. It is currently used during emergency transport of children with severe croup. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it relieves respiratory distress. This review updates versions published in 2010 and 2013. Objectives To examine the effect of heliox compared to oxygen or other active interventions, placebo, or no treatment, on relieving signs and symptoms in children with croup as determined by a croup score and rates of admission and intubation. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; and LILACS in January and February 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ) and ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ) on 8 February 2018. We contacted British Oxygen Company, a leading supplier of heliox ( BOC Australia 2017 ). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing the effect of heliox in comparison with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported data that could not be pooled for statistical analysis descriptively. Main results We included 3 RCTs with 91 children aged between 6 months and 4 years. Study duration was from 7 to 16 months; all studies were conducted in emergency departments in the USA (two studies) and Spain. Heliox was administered as a mixture of 70% heliox and 30% oxygen. Risk of bias was low in two studies and high in one study due to an open‐label design. We added no new trials for this update. One study of 15 children with mild croup compared heliox with 30% humidified oxygen administered for 20 minutes. There may be no difference in croup score changes between groups at 20 minutes (mean difference (MD) ‐0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.36 to 0.70). The mean croup score at 20 minutes postintervention may not differ between groups (MD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐1.46 to 0.32). There may be no difference between groups in mean respiratory rate (MD 6.40, 95% CI ‐1.38 to 14.18) and mean heart rate (MD 14.50, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 37.49) at 20 minutes. The evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was of low quality, downgraded for serious imprecision. All children were discharged, but information on hospitalisation, intubation, or re‐presenting to emergency departments was not reported. In another study, 47 children with moderate croup received one dose of oral dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) with either heliox for 60 minutes or no treatment. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 60 minutes postintervention (MD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐1.96 to ‐0.24), but there may be no difference between groups at 120 minutes (MD ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐4.86 to 3.46). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean Taussig croup scores at 60 minutes (MD ‐1.11, 95% CI ‐2.05 to ‐0.17) but not at 120 minutes (MD ‐0.71, 95% CI ‐1.72 to 0.30). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean respiratory rates at 60 minutes (MD ‐4.94, 95% CI ‐9.66 to ‐0.22), but there may be no difference at 120 minutes (MD ‐3.17, 95% CI ‐7.83 to 1.49). There may be no difference in hospitalisation rates between groups (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). We assessed the evidence for all outcomes i this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to imprecision and high risk of bias related to open‐label design. Information on heart rate and intubation was not reported. In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup received intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) and either heliox with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of adrenaline for three hours. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 90 minutes postintervention, but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting. Information on hospitalisation or re‐presenting to the emergency department was not reported. The included studies did not report on adverse events, intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety. We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study. Authors' conclusions Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen for children with mild croup, but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup treated with dexamethasone. The effect may be similar to 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline. Adverse events were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup. Plain language summary Helium‐oxygen (heliox) treatment for children with croup Review question We assessed whether inhaling heliox is safe and beneficial in treating children with croup compared with fake treatment (placebo) or other therapies such as 30% humidified oxygen, or 100% oxygen with epinephrine (adrenaline, a drug that helps open airways). Background Croup is a short‐term illness that causes upper airways blockages. Croup is common among children aged up to six years, and is triggered by viral infections; it is more frequent in autumn and winter. Symptoms include barking cough, hoarseness, abnormal breathing sounds, and chest wall retractions. Corticosteroid drugs are standard treatment for children with croup, but a limitation of this treatment is that time is needed for the drug to take effect. Children with severe croup may need additional emergency treatments such as a breathing tube or mechanical breathing support. Children with severe croup may need oxygen and adrenaline inhaled as a fine mist (nebulised). Adrenaline is generally safe, but can cause side effects such as fast heart rate and anxiety. Identifying a safe, effective, and fast‐acting treatment is important for children and their families. Heliox (a combination of helium and oxygen) gas may improve airflow and relieve breathing distress. Some studies have shown benefits from heliox for children with croup. This review updates versions published in 2010 and 2013. Search date 8 February 2018. Study characteristics We did not include any new trials in this update. We included three randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are allocated by chance to receive a treatment) involving a total of 91 children with croup aged from 6 months to 4 years. Studies ran for between 7 and 16 months; two were conducted in the USA and one in Spain. In one study children with mild croup received either heliox with 30% oxygen; in another study children with moderate croup received oral dexamethasone (a type of corticosteroid) and either heliox or no treatment; and in the third study children with moderate to severe croup received injected dexamethasone and either heliox or 100% oxygen with adrenaline. Key results Heliox may be no more effective than 30% oxygen for children with mild croup; as effective as 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline; and slightly more effect ve than no treatment for children with moderate to severe croup. None of the studies reported adverse events. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was low as the trials included few children, and in one trial children, their families, and the physicians knew which treatment was given.	10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	512	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Occupational therapy delivered by specialists versus non‐specialists for people with schizophrenia	Morris KR, G.  Spencer, S.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that is characterised by positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions; negative symptoms, such as flattened affect, thought disorder (disrupted speech), and lack of motivation; and cognitive symptoms, such as problems with memory and attention. Schizophrenia can occur as an isolated episode, or as a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, and is associated with impairment in psychosocial and occupational functioning. Although antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for people with schizophrenia, in most countries mental health services usually provide a range of add‐on interventions, including occupational therapy. This is a complex intervention designed to support and enable continued participation in daily life through engagement in activities and occupations meaningful to the individual. Occupational therapists are professionals trained to deliver therapy where the emphasis is on improving occupational function and participation rather than treating symptoms, and uses a wide range of methods based on the needs of individuals. However, similar interventions may also be delivered by staff not trained as occupational therapists. Objectives To examine the effects of occupational therapy delivered by occupational therapists compared to occupational therapy delivered by any other person for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers) on 4 November 2016 and 26 July 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials evaluating the functional or clinical outcomes of occupational therapy, or both, for people with schizophrenia delivered by occupational therapists compared with occupational therapy for people with schizophrenia delivered by anyone other than occupational therapists. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. Main results The search yielded 1633 records. Of these, we retrieved 17 full‐text reports (14 studies) for further scrutiny, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Currently there are no randomised controlled trials comparing delivery of occupational therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia by occupational therapists with delivery of similar interventions by anyone other than occupational therapists. Research studies employing methodologically robust trial designs are needed to establish whether or not there are better outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with occupational therapy that is delivered by trained occupational therapists. Plain language summary Occupational therapy for schizophrenia provided by occupational therapists compared to others Review question Is there good‐quality evidence that occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists rather than anyone else? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition with a range of symptoms including hearing voices, unusual beliefs, paranoia, disorganised thinking or speech, and loss of motivation. In addition to people diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving medical treatments, services that support such individuals often provide further therapies such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help improve the functioning and ability to take part in meaningful activities of people with schizophrenia, rather than focusing on reducing symptoms. Occupational therapy may be provided by specialist professionals trained as occupational therapists. However, similar therapy may be provided by other people who are not trained occupational therapists (e.g. doctors, nurses, other allied health professionals, or support staff). We wanted to find out whether there were any differences between the effectiveness of occupational therapy provided by occupational therapists and similar therapy provided by people not trained as occupational therapists. Searching for evidence On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. Evidence found We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full‐text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies. Conclusions At present there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to permit a judgement as to whether occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists compared to anyone else. Research is needed to answer this question and to help service providers plan future services that include occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.	10.1002/14651858.CD012398.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	479	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012398.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the seventh most common cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Treatment consists of a combination of surgical debulking and platinum‐based chemotherapy. Between 55% and 75% of women who respond to first‐line therapy experience relapse within two years. Second‐line chemotherapy is palliative and aims to reduce symptoms and prolong survival. Improved understanding about the molecular basis of EOC has led to the development of novel agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti‐EGFR antibodies. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and harmful effects of interventions that target the epidermal growth factor receptor in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE, and Embase up to October 2010. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. This update includes further searches up to September 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐EGFR agents with or without conventional chemotherapy versus conventional chemotherapy alone or no treatment in women with histologically proven EOC. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently abstracted data, assessed risk of bias, and performed GRADE assessment. Main results From 6105 references obtained through the literature search and an additional 15 references derived from grey literature searches, we identified seven RCTs that met our inclusion criteria and included 1725 participants. Trial results show that after first‐line chemotherapy is provided, maintenance treatment with erlotinib (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)) probably makes little or no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.20; one study; 835 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and may make little or no difference in progression‐free survival (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23; one study; 835 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Less than 50% of participants provided quality of life data, and study authors reported these results incompletely. The certainty of evidence is very low, but treatment may reduce quality of life compared to observation. Treatment with an EGFR TKI (vandetanib) for women with relapsed EOC may make little or no difference in overall survival (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.95; one study; 129 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and may make little or no difference in progression‐free survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.42; one study; 129 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In treating patients with relapse, giving EGFR TKI may slightly increase some toxicities, such as severe rash (risk ratio (RR) 13.63, 95% CI 0.78 to 236.87; one study; 125 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life data were not available for meta‐analysis. Anti‐EGFR antibody treatment in relapsed EOC may or may not make a difference to overall survival (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.18; four studies; 658 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may or may not have any effect on progression‐free survival (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; four studies; 658 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Anti‐EGFR antibody treatment may or may not increase side effects, including severe nausea and/or vomiting (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.89; three studies; 503 participants; low‐certainty evidence), severe fatigue (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.73; I² = 0%; four studies; 652 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and hypokalaemia (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 5.06; I² = 0%; three studies; 522 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Severe diarrhoea rates were heterogeneous across studies (RR 2 87, 95% CI 0.59 to 13.89; four studies; 652 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and subgroup analysis revealed that severe diarrhoea was more likely with pertuzumab (RR 6.37, 95% CI 1.89 to 21.45; I² = 0%; three studies; 432 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than with seribantumab treatment (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.23; I² = 0%; one study; 220 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life data were incompletely reported, and we were unable to combine them in a meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions Current evidence suggests that an anti‐EGFR single‐agent biological treatment (EGFR TKI or anti‐EGFR antibody) makes little or no difference to survival, either as maintenance treatment after first‐line chemotherapy or in association with chemotherapy in recurrent cancer. Anti‐EGFR therapy may increase some side effects and may or may not reduce quality of life. Plain language summary Do epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, alone or with chemotherapy, improve outcomes for women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)? What is the aim of this review?   The aim of this review was to find out if medicines that inhibit epidermal growth factor receptors improve the outcomes of women with EOC and to identify the harms of treatment. We sought to collect and analyse results of all relevant studies to answer this question and found seven studies. What are the key messages of the review?   Limited evidence suggests that there is little or no benefit from taking anti‐EGFR agents either alongside chemotherapy at relapse, or as maintenance treatment after first‐line chemotherapy for EOC, and that some side effects may be increased. What was studied in the review?   Approximately a quarter of gynaecological cancers are of ovarian origin, although they account for half of all deaths related to gynaecological cancers. The annual incidence worldwide is about 6.6 cases per 100,000 women, with an annual mortality rate of four deaths per 100,000 women, as three‐quarters of these cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Treatment usually consists of a combination of surgery to remove as much of the visible cancer as possible (debulking surgery) and platinum‐based chemotherapy. Most cases of EOC (70% to 80%) respond to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, most women with advanced disease experience relapse and ultimately die because of resistance to chemotherapy. EGFR is involved in controlling cell growth. High EGFR activity is linked to development of EOC and to poor outcomes. Preventing EGFR activity is an attractive target for novel therapeutic agents. Anti‐EGFR agents have been developed and have been tried in combination with chemotherapy or as maintenance treatment after chemotherapy. What are the main results of the review?   This review found evidence from seven studies on the effects of an anti‐EGFR antibody or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (erlotinib and vandetanib) in women treated for EOC. This was given either as maintenance treatment, following completion of first‐line chemotherapy, or for EOC that had grown after initial treatment (recurrent or refractory disease) . We found low‐certainty evidence to suggest that following first‐line chemotherapy, maintenance treatment with erlotinib probably makes little or no difference in overall survival, and very low‐certainty evidence that it makes little or no difference in progression‐free survival (time before cancer starts to grow again). Treatment may reduce quality of life compared to no treatment (observation), but minimal data were available, and we have very low‐certainty about these findings. Data on adverse events were not available for inclusion in the meta‐analysis. We found low‐certainty evidence to suggest that treatment with vandetanib for women with relapsed EOC probably makes little or no difference in overall survival, and very low‐certainty evidence that it makes little or no difference in progression‐free survival. Vandetanib treatment probably increases the risk of a severe r sh, but data on other side effects were of very low‐certainty due to small numbers and very wide confidence intervals. We found moderate‐certainty evidence to show that treatment with an anti‐EGFR antibody probably makes little or no difference in overall survival, and low‐certainty evidence suggesting that it may make little or no difference in progression‐free survival in cases of relapsed disease. Treatment with the anti‐EGFR antibody pertuzumab probably increases the risk of diarrhoea (low‐certainty), but evidence for its effect on other side effects is of very low‐certainty due to low numbers of events.	10.1002/14651858.CD007927.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	514	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007927.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Ergonomic interventions for preventing musculoskeletal disorders in dental care practitioners	Mulimani PH, V. C. W.  Hayes, M. J.  Idiculla, J. J.  Abas, A. B. L.  Karanth, L.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Dentistry is a profession with a high prevalence of work‐related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) among practitioners, with symptoms often starting as early in the career as the student phase. Ergonomic interventions in physical, cognitive, and organisational domains have been suggested to prevent their occurrence, but evidence of their effects remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effect of ergonomic interventions for the prevention of work‐related musculoskeletal disorders among dental care practitioners. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO ProQuest, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC‐2, HSELINE, CISDOC (OSH‐UPDATE), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal to August 2018, without language or date restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster RCTs, in which participants were adults, aged 18 and older, who were engaged in the practice of dentistry. At least 75% of them had to be free from musculoskeletal pain at baseline. We only included studies that measured at least one of our primary outcomes; i.e. physician diagnosed WMSD, self‐reported pain, or work functioning. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently screened and selected 20 potentially eligible references from 946 relevant references identified from the search results. Based on the full‐text screening, we included two studies, excluded 16 studies, and two are awaiting classification. Four review authors independently extracted data, and two authors assessed the risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included two RCTs (212 participants), one of which was a cluster‐randomised trial. Adjusting for the design effect from clustering, reduced the total sample size to 210. Both studies were carried out in dental clinics and assessed ergonomic interventions in the physical domain, one by evaluating a multi‐faceted ergonomic intervention, which consisted of imparting knowledge and training about ergonomics, work station modification, training and surveying ergonomics at the work station, and a regular exercise program; the other by studying the effectiveness of two different types of instrument used for scaling in preventing WMSDs. We were unable to combine the results from the two studies because of the diversity of interventions and outcomes. Physical ergonomic interventions . Based on one study, there is very low‐quality evidence that a multi‐faceted intervention has no clear effect on dentists' risk of WMSD in the thighs (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.42; 102 participants), or feet (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.41; 102 participants) when compared to no intervention over a six‐month period. Based on one study, there is low‐quality evidence of no clear difference in elbow pain (MD −0.14, 95% CI −0.39 to 0.11; 110 participants), or shoulder pain (MD −0.32, 95% CI −0.75 to 0.11; 110 participants) in participants who used light weight curettes with wider handles or heavier curettes with narrow handles for scaling over a 16‐week period. Cognitive ergonomic interventions. We found no studies evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive ergonomic interventions. Organisational ergonomic interventions. We found no studies evaluating the effectiveness of organisational ergonomic interventions. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐quality evidence from one study showing that a multi‐faceted intervention has no clear effect on dentists' risk of WMSD in the thighs or feet when compared to no intervention over a six‐month period. This was a poorly conducted study with several shortcomings and errors in statistical analysis of data. There is low‐quality evidence from one study showing no clear ifference in elbow pain or shoulder pain in participants using light weight, wider handled curettes or heavier and narrow handled curettes for scaling over a 16‐week period. We did not find any studies evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive ergonomic interventions or organisational ergonomic interventions. Our ability to draw definitive conclusions is restricted by the paucity of suitable studies available to us, and the high risk of bias of the studies that are available. This review highlights the need for well‐designed, conducted, and reported RCTs, with long‐term follow‐up that assess prevention strategies for WMSDs among dental care practitioners. Plain language summary Ergonomic interventions to prevent musculoskeletal disorders among dental care practitioners What is the aim of this review? Dental care providers are more prone to injuries and disorders of the bones, muscles, and joints, which are known as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), due to the physically and mentally stressful nature of their work. Various measures or solutions have been suggested to prevent work‐related MSDs (WMSDs). These are known as ergonomic interventions, which means harmonising things with which people interact, in order to meet people's needs, abilities, and limitations. Ergonomic interventions fall under physical, cognitive (mental), or organisational domains. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if any of these ergonomic interventions were effective in preventing WMSDs among dental care practitioners. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found two relevant studies. Key messages There is very low‐quality evidence from one study, that a comprehensive ergonomics intervention, consisting of training, work station modification, and a regular exercise program has no effect on dentists' risk of WMSDs in the thighs or feet, over a period of six months. There is low‐quality evidence from one study that changing the tools used for scraping off dental plaque has no clear effect on dentists' elbow pain or shoulder pain over a four‐month period. Both included studies have several shortcomings, and did not follow‐up with participants for a sufficiently long period of time. We found no studies that evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive or organisational ergonomics interventions. We need better studies to evaluate the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions in dental care practitioners. It is very likely that including the results of new studies will change the conclusions of this review. What was studied in the review? Dental practitioners are highly susceptible to occupational hazards like MSDs, which have been attributed to deteriorating quality of life, burnout, and poor health, which often result in some practitioners quitting the profession. It has been suggested that introducing ergonomic interventions, by making improvements in working style, instruments used, dental office designs, physical activity, work posture, mental stress levels, appointment scheduling, or work environment may help to prevent WMSDs. Our review evaluated the effectiveness of all of these interventions in preventing WMSDs among those who practiced dentistry, be it dentists, dental hygienists, dental auxiliaries, dental nurses, or dental students. We assessed how well these measures prevented the occurrence of new WMSDs, not how they reduced the severity, or how they eliminated WMSDs that already existed. We evaluated the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions on the number of physician‐diagnosed WMSDs, self‐reported pain, or work ability. What are the main results of the review? We found two studies, involving 212 participants, that were conducted in dental practices or clinics in Iran and the United States. Both studies assessed physical ergonomic interventions. One study assessed a comprehensive ergonomics intervention, consisting of training, work station modification, and a regular exercise program, and the other study assessed two different types of instruments used for carrying out a dental procedure. The first study found that the comprehensive ergonomics intervention did not reduce musculoskeletal pain in the thighs or feet. The second study found that people using the two different kinds of tools for scraping off dental plaque had similar levels of elbow and shoulder pain. These studies had shortcomings, like poor methodology and short follow‐up times, hence we could not draw any definitive conclusions based on their findings. We found no studies that assessed the effectiveness of cognitive or organisational ergonomics interventions. We need studies that are designed, conducted, and reported better to evaluate the effects of physical, cognitive, and organisational ergonomics interventions. How up to date is this review? We searched for studies published up to August 2018.	10.1002/14651858.CD011261.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	499	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011261.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

These are rigid and may block blood vessels leading to acute painful crises and other complications. Recent research has focused on therapies to rehydrate the sickled cells by reducing the loss of water and ions from them. Little is known about the effectiveness and safety of such drugs. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the relative risks and benefits of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We also searched online trials registries for any ongoing trials (01 July 2018). Last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 08 October 2018. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Main results Of the 51 studies identified, three met the inclusion criteria, including 524 people with sickle cell disease aged between 12 and 65 years of age. One study tested the effectiveness of zinc sulphate as compared to placebo and the remaining two assessed senicapoc versus placebo. No deaths were seen in any of the studies (low‐quality evidence). The zinc sulphate study showed a significant reduction in painful crises (in a total of 145 participants) over one and a half years, mean difference ‐2.83 (95% confidence interval ‐3.51 to ‐2.15) (moderate‐quality evidence). However, analysis was restricted due to limited statistical data. Changes to red blood cell parameters and blood counts were inconsistent (very low‐quality evidence). No serious adverse events were noted in the study. The Phase II dose‐finding study of senicapoc (a Gardos channel blocker) compared to placebo showed that the high dose senicapoc showed significant improvement in change in hemoglobin level, the number and proportion of dense red blood cells, red blood cell count and indices and hematocrit value (very low‐quality evidence). The results with low‐dose senicapoc were similar to the high‐dose senicapoc group but of lesser magnitude. There was no difference in the frequency of painful crises between the three groups (low‐quality evidence). A subsequent Phase III study of senicapoc was terminated early since there was no difference observed between the treatment and control groups in the primary end point of painful crises. Authors' conclusions While the results of zinc for reducing sickle‐related crises are encouraging, larger and longer‐term multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy for people with sickle cell disease. While the Phase II and the prematurely terminated phase III studies of senicapoc showed that the drug improved red blood cell survival (depending on dose), this did not lead to fewer painful crises. Given this is no longer an active area of research, this review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Drugs that aim to reduce the loss of water from red blood cells in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence to assess the relative risks and benefits of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells. Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition that causes red blood cells to become sickle shaped when they lose water. This leads to a high risk of the blood vessels becoming blocked. Such blockages can cause pain, stroke and damage to organs. Recent therapies aim to stop the cells becoming sickle shaped by preventing them losing water. Search date The evidence is current to: 08 October 2018. Study characteristics The review included three studies with 524 people with sickle cell disease aged between 12 and 65 years of age. The intervention in one study was zinc sulphate and i two studies was senicapoc. Each study was compared to a placebo group (a substance which contains no medication). For each study people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The studies lasted from three months to 18 months. Key results The study with zinc sulphate showed that this drug may be able to reduce the number of sickle cell crises without causing toxic effects (low‐quality evidence). There were 145 participants in this study and results showed a significant reduction in the total number of serious sickle‐related crises over one and a half years, mean difference ‐2.83 (95% confidence interval ‐3.51 to ‐2.15) (moderate‐quality evidence). However, our analysis was limited since not all data were reported. Changes to red blood cell measurements and blood counts were not consistent (very low‐quality evidence). No serious adverse events were noted in the study. The two studies with senicapoc demonstrated that this drug increases the red blood survival and has a role in preventing red blood cell dehydration in people with sickle cell disease (very low‐quality evidence). The higher dose of the drug was more effective compared to the lower dose. But these changes in the red blood cells did not translate into positive clinical outcomes in terms of reduction in the number of sickle cell crises (low‐quality evidence). Senicapoc had a favourable safety profile. More longer‐term research is needed on these drugs and others that might prevent water loss in red blood cells. Given this is no longer an active area of research, this review will no longer be regularly updated. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was mixed across outcomes.	10.1002/14651858.CD003426.pub6	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	522	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003426.pub6	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Type II or type III radical hysterectomy compared to chemoradiotherapy as a primary intervention for stage IB2 cervical cancer	Nama VA, G.  Twigg, J.  Murdoch, J. B.  Bailey, J.  Lawrie, T. A.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with 528,000 estimated new cases globally in 2012. A large majority (around 85%) of the disease burden occurs in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where it accounts for almost 12% of all female cancers. Treatment of stage IB2 cervical cancers, which sit between early and advanced disease, is controversial. Some centres prefer to treat these cancers by radical hysterectomy, with chemoradiotherapy reserved for those at high risk of recurrence. In the UK, we treat stage IB2 cervical cancers mainly with chemoradiotherapy, based on the rationale that a high percentage will have risk factors necessitating chemoradiotherapy postsurgery. There has been no systematic review to determine the best possible evidence in managing these cancers. Objectives To determine if primary surgery for stage IB2 cervical cancer (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy) improves survival compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. To determine if primary surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, for stage IB2 cervical cancer increases patient morbidity in the management of stage IB2 cervical cancer compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to April week 2, 2018) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2018 week 16). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies up to April 2018. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs or non‐randomised studies (NRSs) comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, abstracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified 4968 records from the literature searches, but we did not identify any RCTs that compared primary surgery with chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer. We found one NRS comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancers which met the inclusion criteria. However, we were unable to obtain data for stage IB2 cancers only and considered the findings very uncertain due to a high risk of selection bias. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of high‐certainty evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary radical hysterectomy versus primary chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer. More research is needed on the different treatment options in stage IB2 cervical cancer, particularly with respect to survival, adverse effects, and quality of life to facilitate informed decision‐making and individualised care. Plain language summary Surgery or chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer The issue   Treatment of cervical cancers that are larger than 4 cm still thought to be confined to the cervix (classified as stage IB2 cervical cancer) is controversial. Some clinicians believe that a combination of radiotherapy (high‐energy rays) and chemotherapy (anti‐cancer drugs), together known as chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation, is better when the tumours are larger than 4 cm. This is based on the argument that the chance of the cancer returning after surgery is high, therefore most women will need chemoradiotherapy, even if they have surgery initially. The other school of thought is that these tumours are so large that they do not respond well to chemoradiotherapy and women with this stage of cervical cancer would benefit from surgery despite being at high risk of needing chemoradiotherapy after surgery. However, there are concerns about toxicity and complications related to the use of both surgery and chemoradiotherapy in women with cervical cancer, as receiving both treatments can increase morbidity. Therefore, many centres have moved towards pr viding only chemoradiotherapy. As there remains uncertainty about which treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) is better for women with stage IB2 cervical cancer, we conducted this systematic review to try and answer this question.    How we conducted the review   We searched for evidence that compared chemoradiotherapy to surgery (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy) from 1946 to April 2018. We searched for both randomised controlled trials (where people taking part are put into groups at random) and non‐randomised studies (in which a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time).    What we found   We only found one non‐randomised study that compared surgery with chemoradiotherapy, but this study combined data on stages IB2 to IIA. Although it met the inclusion criteria, we could not analyse the data as we could not extract data specific to stage IB2 cervical cancers, therefore we considered the findings of this study to be uncertain with respect to our review question.    Conclusions   At present, there is no high‐certainty evidence to inform us of which of the current treatment options (chemoradiotherapy or radical surgery) is better for stage IB2 cervical cancer. Women with stage IB2 cervical cancer should be counselled regarding this uncertainty and potential side effects, and the choice of treatment should take into account the availability of the treatments in a particular health resource and patient preference. Ideally, a large multicentred trial is needed to determine which of the two treatments are better for treating women with stage IB2 cervical cancer. However, because of the relative rarity of stage 1B2 cancer, and the potential complications resulting from combining surgery and chemoradiotherapy, clinicians might continue to treat most women with chemoradiotherapy, and trials in this field might not be feasible.	10.1002/14651858.CD011478.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	473	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011478.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair‐wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure‐free and go into long‐term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are commonly used broad‐spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first‐line treatment for focal onset seizures, and is used in the USA and Europe. Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first‐line treatment because of concerns over associated adverse events, particularly documented behavioural adverse events in children treated with the drug. However, phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low‐ and middle‐income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these trials are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy. Objectives To review the time to treatment failure, remission and first seizure with carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalised), or generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). Search methods For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 24 May 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes Cochrane Epilepsy's Specialized Register and CENTRAL; MEDLINE; the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing monotherapy with either carbamazepine or phenobarbitone in children or adults with focal onset seizures or generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures. Data collection and analysis This was an individual participant data (IPD), review. Our primary outcome was time to treatment failure. Our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post‐randomisation, time to six‐month remission, time to 12‐month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial‐specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI. Main results We included 13 trials in this review and IPD were available for 836 individuals out of 1455 eligible individuals from six trials, 57% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, a HR of less than 1 indicates an advantage for phenobarbitone and for first seizure and treatment failure outcomes a HR of less than 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. Results for the primary outcome of the review were: time to treatment failure for any reason related to treatment (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 676 participants: 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86, moderate‐quality evidence), time to treatment failure due to adverse events (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 619 participants: 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97, low‐quality evidence), time to treatment failure due to lack of efficacy (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 487 participants: 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78, moderate‐quality evidence), showing a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine compared to phenobarbitone. For our secondary ou comes, we did not find any statistically significant differences between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone: time to first seizure post‐randomisation (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 822 participants: 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38, moderate‐quality evidence), time to 12‐month remission (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 683 participants: 1.09, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.40, low‐quality evidence), and time to six‐month remission pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 683 participants: 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24, low‐quality evidence). Results of these secondary outcomes suggest that there may be an association between treatment effect in terms of efficacy and seizure type; that is, that participants with focal onset seizures experience seizure recurrence later and hence remission of seizures earlier on phenobarbitone than carbamazepine, and vice versa for individuals with generalised seizures. It is likely that the analyses of these outcomes were confounded by several methodological issues and misclassification of seizure type, which could have introduced the heterogeneity and bias into the results of this review. Limited information was available regarding adverse events in the trials and we could not compare the rates of adverse events between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone. Some adverse events reported on both drugs were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, drowsiness, motor and cognitive disturbances, dysmorphic side effects (such as rash), and behavioural side effects in three paediatric trials. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence from this review suggests that carbamazepine is likely to be a more effective drug than phenobarbitone in terms of treatment retention (treatment failures due to lack of efficacy or adverse events or both). Moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence from this review also suggests an association between treatment efficacy and seizure type in terms of seizure recurrence and seizure remission, with an advantage for phenobarbitone for focal onset seizures and an advantage for carbamazepine for generalised onset seizures. However, some of the trials contributing to the analyses had methodological inadequacies and inconsistencies that may have impacted upon the results of this review. Therefore, we do not suggest that results of this review alone should form the basis of a treatment choice for a patient with newly onset seizures. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow‐up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results. Plain language summary Carbamazepine versus phenobarbitone monotherapy (single drug treatment) for epilepsy This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in Issue 12, 2016 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews . Background Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures, in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain; and focal onset seizures, in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain). Focal seizures may become generalised (secondary generalisation), and move from one part of the brain throughout the brain. For around 70% of people with epilepsy, a single antiepileptic medication can control generalised onset or focal onset seizures. This review applies to people with focal seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) and people with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures, a specific generalised seizure type. This review does not apply to people with other generalised seizure types such as absence seizures or myoclonic seizures, as the recommended treatments for these seizure types are different. Worldwide, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are commonly used antiepi eptic drugs, however, carbamazepine is used more commonly in the USA and Europe because of concerns over side‐effects associated with phenobarbitone, particularly concerns over behavioural changes in children treated with phenobarbitone. Phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low‐ and middle‐income countries in Africa, Asia, and South America because of the low cost of the drug. Objective The aim of this review was to compare how effective these drugs are at controlling seizures, to find out if they are associated with side effects that may result in individuals stopping the medication, and to inform a choice between these medications. Methods The last search for trials was in May 2018. We assessed the evidence from 13 clinical trials in which people received either carbamazepine or phenobarbitone and their treatment was decided randomly. We were able to combine data for 836 people from six of the 13 trials; for the remaining 619 people from seven trials, data were not available to use in this review. Key results Results of the review suggest that people are likely to stop taking phenobarbitone treatment earlier than carbamazepine treatment, because of seizure recurrence, side‐effects of the drug, or both. Results also suggest that recurrence of seizures after starting treatment with phenobarbitone may happen later than treatment with carbamazepine (and therefore a seizure free period of 6 months or 12 months may occur earlier with phenobarbitone than with carbamazepine) for people with focal onset seizures, and vice‐versa for people with generalised onset seizures. Some side effects reported by people taking carbamazepine and people taking phenobarbitone were abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, motor problems (such as poor co‐ordination), cognitive problems (poor memory), rashes and other skin problems. Behavioural side effects such as aggression were reported on both drugs in three trials in children. Quality of the evidence Some of the trials contributing data to the review had methodological problems, which may have introduced bias and inconsistent results into this review, and some individuals over the age of 30 with newly diagnosed generalised onset seizures may have had their seizure type wrongly diagnosed. These problems may have affected the results of this review and we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be moderate to low quality. We do not suggest using the results of this review alone for making a choice between carbamazepine or phenobarbitone for the treatment of epilepsy. We recommend that all future trials comparing these drugs or any other antiepileptic drugs should be designed using high‐quality methods to ensure results are also of high quality.	10.1002/14651858.CD001904.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	494	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001904.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair‐wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure‐free and go into long‐term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, phenytoin is a commonly used antiepileptic drug. It is important to know how newer drugs, such as oxcarbazepine, compare with commonly used standard treatments. Objectives To review the time to treatment failure, remission and first seizure with oxcarbazepine compared to phenytoin, when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures or generalised tonic‐clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). Search methods We searched the following databases on 20 August 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 20 August 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov , and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ). We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing monotherapy with either oxcarbazepine or phenytoin in children or adults with focal onset seizures or generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures. Data collection and analysis This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to treatment failure and our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post‐randomisation, time to six‐month and 12‐month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial‐specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI. Main results Individual participant data were available for 480 out of a total of 517 participants (93%), from two out of three included trials. For remission outcomes, a HR of less than one indicated an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and treatment failure outcomes, a HR of less than one indicated an advantage for oxcarbazepine. The results for time to treatment failure for any reason related to treatment showed a potential advantage of oxcarbazepine over phenytoin, but this was not statistically significant (pooled HR adjusted for epilepsy type: 0.78 95% CI 0.53 to 1.14, 476 participants, two trials, moderate‐quality evidence). Our analysis showed that treatment failure due to adverse events occurred later on with oxcarbazepine than phenytoin (pooled HR for all participants: 0.22 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.51, 480 participants, two trials, high‐quality evidence). Our analysis of time to treatment failure due to lack of efficacy showed no clear difference between the drugs (pooled HR for all participants: 1.17 (95% CI 0.31 to 4.35), 480 participants, two trials, moderate‐quality evidence). We found no clear or statistically significant differences between drugs for any of the secondary outcomes of the review: time to first seizure post‐randomisation (pooled HR adjusted for epilepsy type: 0.97 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26, 468 participants, two trials, moderate‐quality evidence); time to 12‐month remission (pooled HR adjusted for epilepsy type 1.04 95% CI 0.77 to 1.41, 468 participants, two trials, moderate‐quality evidence) and time to six‐month remission (pooled HR adjusted for epilepsy type: 1.06 95% CI 0.82 to 1.36, 468 participants, two trials, moderate‐quality evidence). The most common adverse events reported in more than 10% of participants on either drug were somnolence (28% of total participants, with similar rates for both drugs), headache (15% of total participants, with similar rates for both drugs), dizziness (14.5% of total participants, reported by slightly more participants on phenytoin (18%) than oxcarbazepine (11%)) and gum hyperplasia (reported by substantially more participants on phenytoin (18%) than oxcarbazepine (2%)). The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with focal onset seizures; 70% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. The two studies included in IPD meta‐analysis were generally of good methodological quality but the design of the studies may have biased the results for the secondary outcomes (time to first seizure post‐randomisation, time to six‐month and 12‐month remission) as seizure recurrence data were not collected following treatment failure or withdrawal from the study. In addition, misclassification of epilepsy type may have impacted on results, particularly for individuals with generalised onset seizures. Authors' conclusions High‐quality evidence provided by this review indicates that treatment failure due to adverse events occurs significantly later with oxcarbazepine than phenytoin. For individuals with focal onset seizures, moderate‐quality evidence suggests that oxcarbazepine may be superior to phenytoin in terms of treatment failure for any reason, seizure recurrence and seizure remission. Therefore, oxcarbazepine may be a preferable alternative treatment than phenytoin, particularly for individuals with focal onset seizures. The evidence in this review which relates to individuals with generalised onset seizures is of low quality and does not inform current treatment policy. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with regards to choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow‐up (including continued follow‐up after failure or withdrawal of randomised treatment), choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results. Plain language summary Oxcarbazepine versus phenytoin monotherapy (single medication treatment) for epilepsy This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in Issue 2, 2006 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews . Background Epilepsy is a common disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures, in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain; and focal onset seizures, in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain). Focal seizures may become generalised (secondary generalisation) and move from one part of the brain throughout the brain. For around 70% of people with epilepsy, a single antiepileptic medication can control generalised onset or focal onset seizures. Objective Worldwide, phenytoin is a commonly used antiepileptic medication and oxcarbazepine is one of a newer generation of antiepileptic medications. The aim of this review was to compare how effective these medications are at controlling seizures, to find out if they are associated with side effects that may result in individuals stopping the medication, and to help people choose between these medications. Methods We assessed the evidence from three studies (specifically, randomised controlled trials) comparing oxcarbazepine with phenytoin. We were able to combine information for 480 people from two of the three trials. For the remaining 37 people from one trial, information was not available to use in this review. The evidence is current to 20 August 2018. Results The review found that people taking oxcarbazepine stop taking treatment because of side effects significantly later than people taking phenytoin. Our results also showed that people with focal onset seizures taking phenytoin may stop aking treatment for any reason earlier than people with focal onset seizures taking oxcarbazepine. The results also suggest that people with focal onset seizures taking oxcarbazepine may experience a repeat seizure later, and achieve freedom from seizures earlier, than people with focal onset seizures taking phenytoin. There was no clear difference between the drugs in terms of withdrawal from the treatment, seizure recurrence and seizure remission for individuals with generalised onset seizures. Quality of the evidence The two studies included in analysis were well designed but no information about seizures was recorded after people stopped taking their trial medication, which may have impacted on the results of the study. Most people (70%) included in the studies within this review had focal onset seizures, so the results are mainly relevant to people with this epilepsy type. Also up to 30% of the people in the trials used in our results may have been wrongly classified as having generalised seizures, which may have impacted on the results. For these reasons, we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be of moderate quality for people with focal onset seizures, and low quality for people with generalised onset seizures. Conclusions For people with focal onset seizures, oxcarbazepine may be a preferable treatment to phenytoin, but more information is needed for people with generalised onset seizures to choose between these medications. We recommend that all future trials comparing these medications, or any other antiepileptic medications, should be designed using high‐quality methods. Seizure types of people included in trials should also be classified very carefully.	10.1002/14651858.CD003615.pub4	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	492	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003615.pub4	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, it is unclear whether the clinical trial evidence supports this. Objectives To compare effects on allergic disease when infants are fed a hydrolysed formula versus CMF or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective, including extensively or partially hydrolysed formula (EHF/PHF). To determine whether infants at low or high risk of allergic disease, and whether infants receiving early short‐term (first few days after birth) or prolonged formula feeding benefit from hydrolysed formulas. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1948 to 3 November 2017), and Embase (1974 to 3 November 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles and previous reviews for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria We searched for randomised and quasi‐randomised trials that compared use of a hydrolysed formula versus human milk or CMF. Outcomes with ≥ 80% follow‐up of participants from eligible trials were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included studies. Fixed‐effect analyses were performed. The treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals and quality of evidence using the GRADE quality of evidence approach. The primary outcome was all allergic disease (including asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and food allergy). Main results A total of 16 studies were included. Two studies assessed the effect of three to four days infant supplementation with an EHF while in hospital after birth versus pasteurised human milk feed. A single study enrolling 90 infants reported no difference in all allergic disease (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.38 to 5.37) or any specific allergic disease up to childhood including cow's milk allergy (CMA) (RR 7.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 143.84). A single study reported no difference in infant CMA (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.46; participants = 3559). Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. No eligible trials compared prolonged hydrolysed formula versus human milk feeding. Two studies assessed the effect of three to four days infant supplementation with an EHF versus a CMF. A single study enrolling 90 infants reported no difference in all allergic disease (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.33 to 5.71; participants = 77) or any specific allergic disease including CMA up to childhood. A single study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.00; participants = 3473). Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. Twelve studies assessed the effect of prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF. The data showed no difference in all allergic disease in infants (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; participants = 2852; studies = 8) and children (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; participants = 950; studies = 2), and no difference in any specific allergic disease including infant asthma (typical RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.04; participants = 318; studies = 4), eczema (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09; participants = 2896; studies = 9), rhinitis (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.85; participants = 256; studies = 3), food allergy (typical RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.33; participants = 479; studies = 2), and CMA (RR 2.31, 95% CI 0.24 to 21.97; participants = 338; studies = 1). Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to support short‐term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with exclusive breast feeding for preventi n of allergic disease. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that short‐term use of an EHF compared with a CMF may prevent infant CMA. Further trials are recommended before implementation of this practice. We found no evidence to support prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF for prevention of allergic disease in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed. Plain language summary Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease in infants Review question Does feeding infants with a formula containing hydrolysed protein result in decreased risk of developing allergic disease such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever and food allergy during infancy and childhood? Background Allergic disease is responsible for a substantial health burden among infants, children and adults. Early dietary intake may influence the development of allergic disease. When babies are not exclusively breast fed, use of hydrolysed formula instead of ordinary cow's milk formula may reduce allergic disease among babies and children, although additional studies are needed to confirm this. Infant formulas have been designed to lower the chance of infants developing allergic disease. These include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy milk formulas. Hydrolysed formulas break down milk proteins into smaller, potentially less allergy‐producing proteins. Results This review of trials found no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula to prevent allergic disease in preference to exclusive breast feeding. This review also found that for infants who are unable to be exclusively breast fed, there is no evidence that prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a cow's milk is associated with any difference in allergic disease, asthma, eczema, rhinitis, food allergy or cow's milk formula at any time point. However, limited data in infants who are exclusively formula fed suggest that feeding with a hydrolysed formula instead of a cow's milk formula may reduce infant allergic disease. Concerns regarding quality of the evidence and consistency of the results indicate that continued study is needed. The evidence in this review comes from literature searches updated until November 2017. Conclusions We found no substantial evidence to support short‐term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a cow's milk formula for prevention of allergic disease in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed.	10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub6	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	525	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub6	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Parent‐mediated interventions for promoting communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome	O'Toole CL, A. S. Y.  Gibbon, F. E.  van Bysterveldt, A. K.  Hart, N. J.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Communication and language development are areas of particular weakness for young children with Down syndrome. Caregivers' interaction with children influences language development, so many early interventions involve training parents how best to respond to their children and provide appropriate language stimulation. Thus, these interventions are mediated through parents, who in turn are trained and coached in the implementation of interventions by clinicians. As the interventions involve a considerable commitment from clinicians and families, we undertook this review to synthesise the evidence of their effectiveness. Objectives To assess the effects of parent‐mediated interventions for improving communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome. Other outcomes are parental behaviour and responsivity, parental stress and satisfaction, and children's non‐verbal means of communicating, socialisation and behaviour. Search methods In January 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and 14 other databases. We also searched three trials registers, checked the reference lists of relevant reports identified by the electronic searches, searched the websites of professional organizations, and contacted their staff and other researchers working in the field to identify other relevant published, unpublished and ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared parent‐mediated interventions designed to improve communication and language versus teaching/treatment as usual (TAU) or no treatment or delayed (wait‐listed) treatment, in children with Down syndrome aged between birth and six years. We included studies delivering the parent‐mediated intervention in conjunction with a clinician‐mediated intervention, as long as the intervention group was the only group to receive the former and both groups received the latter. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data collection and analysis. Main results We included three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years with Down syndrome. Two studies compared parent‐mediated interventions versus TAU; the third compared a parent‐mediated plus clinician‐mediated intervention versus a clinician‐mediated intervention alone. Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months. One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home‐based sessions over a 13‐week period. Another study provided weekly, individual clinic‐based or home‐based sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours, over a six‐month period. The third study provided one 2‐ to 3‐hour group session followed by bi‐weekly, individual clinic‐based sessions plus once‐weekly home‐based sessions for 12 weeks. Because of the different study designs and outcome measures used, we were unable to conduct a meta‐analysis. We judged all three studies to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants (not possible due to the nature of the intervention) and blinding of outcome assessors, and at an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. We judged one study to be at unclear risk of selection bias, as authors did not report the methods used to generate the random sequence; at high risk of reporting bias, as they did not report on one assessed outcome; and at high risk of detection bias, as the control group had a cointervention and only parents in the intervention group were made aware of the target words for their children. The sample sizes of each included study were very small, meaning that they are unlikely to be representative of the target population. The findings from the three included studies were inconsistent. Two studies found no differences in expressive or receptive language abilities between the groups, whether measured by direct assessment or parent reports. However, they did find that children in the intervention group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with la guage targets in certain contexts postintervention, compared to those in the control group; this was not maintained 12 months later. The third study found gains for the intervention group on total‐language measures immediately postintervention. One study did not find any differences in parental stress scores between the groups at any time point up to 12 months postintervention. All three studies noted differences in most measures of how the parents talked to and interacted with their children postintervention, and in one study most strategies were maintained in the intervention group at 12 months postintervention. No study reported evidence of language attrition following the intervention in either group, while one study found positive outcomes on children's socialisation skills in the intervention group. One study looked at adherence to the treatment through attendance data, finding that mothers in the intervention group attended seven out of nine group sessions and were present for four home visits. No study measured parental use of the strategies outside of the intervention sessions. A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study. Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA. The remaining study did not specify any funding sources. In light of the serious limitations in methodology, and the small number of studies included, we considered the overall quality of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the results, and further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects of parent‐mediated interventions for improving the language and communication of children with Down syndrome. We found only three small studies of very low quality. This review highlights the need for well‐designed studies, including RCTs, to evaluate the effectiveness of parent‐mediated interventions. Trials should use valid, reliable and similar measures of language development, and they should include measures of secondary outcomes more distal to the intervention, such as family well‐being. Treatment fidelity, in particular parental dosage of the intervention outside of prescribed sessions, also needs to be documented. Plain language summary Parent‐mediated interventions to promote communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome Review question Do parent‐mediated interventions improve communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome? Background Language development is an area of particular weakness for young children with Down syndrome. Caregivers' interaction with children influences language development, so sometimes clinicians coach parents so they can stimulate their children's language and communication skills. Study characteristics The evidence is current to January 2018. We found three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years. Two studies were randomised controlled trials: experiments in which children were allocated to treatment (i.e. parent‐mediated) and control (treatment as usual or clinician‐mediated, or both) groups using a random method such as a computer‐generated list of random numbers. The other study reported that randomisation took place but did not specify how this was done. Two studies compared parent‐mediated intervention to treatment as usual. One of these lasted for 13 weeks, and parents in the intervention group received nine, weekly group sessions and four individual sessions in the home. The total intervention time was approximately 26.5 hours. A second study lasted for six months, and parents received weekly, 1.5‐ to 2‐hour clinic or home‐based, individualised, parent‐child sessions. The total intervention time was approximately 48 hours. A third study compared parent‐ and clinician‐mediated intervention to a clinician‐only‐mediated intervention. In this study the parents in the intervention group took part in a two‐ to three‐hour interactive workshop plus three individualised sessions (two clinic‐based and one home‐based) every week for 12 weeks. The control group received the same individualised sessions, but a clinician delivered them (i.e. there was no parental involvement). The total intervention time was approximately 19 hours. A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study. Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA. The remaining study did not specify any funding sources. Key results Two of the three studies found no differences in children's language ability after parent training. However, these same two studies found that children in the intervention group used more words that had been specifically targeted, postintervention; this was not maintained 12 months later. The study that gave parents the largest amount of intervention reported gains on general measures of overall language ability for children in the intervention group. One study did not find any changes in levels of parental stress immediately or up to 12 months postintervention in either group. All three studies noted changes in how parents talked to and interacted with their children immediately postintervention, and most strategies were retained by the intervention group 12 months later. One study reported increases in the socialisation skills of children who received the intervention. No study reported language attrition in either group postintervention. Quality of the evidence We rated the quality of the evidence in this review as very low, as only three studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, and all had small sizes and serious methodological limitations. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effect of parent‐mediated interventions for improving the communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome.	10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	529	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Most people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug‐resistant epilepsy, especially those with focal seizures. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of gabapentin, when used as an add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as an add‐on treatment for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. Search methods For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, 20 March 2018), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 20 March 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (20 March 2018) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP , 20 March 2018). We imposed no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, add‐on trials of gabapentin in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. We also included trials using an active drug control group or comparing different doses of gabapentin. Data collection and analysis For this update, two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal (any reason) and adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention‐to‐treat. We also undertook sensitivity best‐case and worst‐case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for each outcome and evaluated dose‐response in regression models. Main results We included 12 trials representing 2607 randomised participants. We combined data from six trials in meta‐analyses of 1206 randomised participants. The overall RR for reduction in seizure frequency of 50% or more compared to placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.55; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Dose regression analysis (for trials in adults) showed increasing efficacy with increasing dose, with 25.3% (19.3 to 32.3) of people responding to gabapentin 1800 mg compared to 9.7% on placebo, a 15.5% increase in response rate (8.5 to 22.5). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Adverse effects were significantly associated with gabapentin compared to placebo. RRs were as follows: ataxia 2.01 (99% CI 0.98 to 4.11; 3 studies, 787 participants; low‐quality evidence), dizziness 2.43 (99% CI 1.44 to 4.12; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), fatigue 1.95 (99% CI 0.99 to 3.82; 5 studies, 1161 participants; low‐quality evidence) and somnolence 1.93 (99% CI 1.22 to 3.06; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no significant differences for the adverse effects of headache (RR 0.79, 99% CI 0.46 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) or nausea (RR 0.95, 99% CI 0.52 to 1.73; 4 trials, 1034 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Overall, the studies were rated at low to unclear risk of bias due to information on each risk of bias domain not being available. We judged the overall quality of evidence (using the GRADE approach) as low to moderate due to potential attrition bias resulting from missing outcome data and imprecise results with wide confidence intervals. Authors' conclusions Gabapentin has efficacy as an add‐on treatment in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long‐term efficacy of gabapentin beyond a three‐month period. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other epilepsy types. Plain language summary Gabapentin as an add‐on for dru ‐resistant focal epilepsy Background Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (well‐designed clinical trials in which people are allocated at random to test a specific drug, treatment or other intervention) are often used to examine how effective and safe antiepileptic medicines are in people who experience such seizures. This review included 12 studies and data from 2607 people with focal seizures (seizures that occur in just one part of the brain). Study characteristics Data from six of the studies were combined in the analysis. All the participants (including adults and children) were previously taking at least one antiepileptic medicine and all were continuing to have seizures. Either gabapentin (an antiepileptic medicine) or a placebo (a tablet that contains no medicine) was added to the medicine regimen. Key results The results showed that gabapentin effectively reduced seizures when used as an additional treatment. Compared to a placebo, gabapentin was almost twice as likely to reduce seizures by 50% or more. The most common side effects associated with gabapentin ware ataxia (poor co‐ordination and unsteady gait), dizziness, fatigue and drowsiness. Quality of the evidence Overall the quality of evidence was low to moderate as information was not reported for all participants in some of the trials and some of the results were imprecise. Research is needed into the effects of the long‐term use of gabapentin. The evidence is current to 20 March 2018.	10.1002/14651858.CD001415.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	491	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001415.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Interventions for replacing missing teeth: attachment systems for implant overdentures in edentulous jaws	Payne AGTA, N. H. M.  Atieh, M. A.  Esposito, M.  Ma, S.  Anas El‐Wegoud, M.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Implant overdentures are one of the most common treatment options used to rehabilitate edentulous patients. Attachment systems are used to anchor the overdentures to implants. The plethora of attachment systems available dictates a need for clinicians to understand their prosthodontic and patient‐related outcomes. Objectives To compare different attachment systems for maxillary and mandibular implant overdentures by assessing prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient preference, patient satisfaction/quality of life and costs. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 January 2018); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 January 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 24 January 2018. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials on maxillary or mandibular implant overdentures with different attachment systems with at least 1 year follow‐up. Data collection and analysis Four review authors extracted data independently and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. Several corresponding authors were subsequently contacted to obtain missing information. Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis was used to combine the outcomes with risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and create 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results We identified six RCTs with a total of 294 mandibular overdentures (including one cross‐over trial). No trials on maxillary overdentures were eligible. Due to the poor reporting of the outcomes across the included trials, only limited analyses between mandibular overdenture attachment systems were possible. Comparing ball and bar attachments, upon pooling the data regarding short‐term prosthodontic success, we identified substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 97%) with inconsistency in the direction of effect, which was unexplained by clinical or methodological differences between the studies, and accordingly we did not perform meta‐analyses for this outcome. Short‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) was higher with ball attachments (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.75; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence), and there was no difference between both attachment systems in short‐term re‐treatment (replacement of attachment system) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with bar attachments. Comparing ball and magnet attachments, there was no difference between them in medium‐term prosthodontic success (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in medium‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.72; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). However, after 5 years, prosthodontic maintenance costs were higher when magnet attachments were used (MD ‐247.37 EUR, 95% CI ‐346.32 to ‐148.42; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in medium‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with magnet attachments. One trial provided data for ball versus telescopic attachments and reported no difference in prosthodontic maintenance between the two systems in short‐term patrix replacement (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 41.96; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix activation (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 177.72; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix replacement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in relining of the implant overdenture (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 6.76; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic maintenance when ball attachments are compared with telescopic attachments. In the only cross‐over trial included, patient preference between different attachment systems was assessed after only 3 months and not for the entire trial period of 10 years. Authors' conclusions For mandibular overdentures, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. In the short term, there is some evidence that is insufficient to show a difference and where there was no evidence was reported. It was not possible to determine any preferred attachment system for mandibular overdentures. For maxillary overdentures, there is no evidence (with no trials identified) to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. Further RCTs on edentulous cohorts must pay attention to trial design specifically using the same number of implants of the same implant system, but with different attachment systems clearly identified in control and test groups. Trials should also determine the longevity of different attachment systems and patient preferences. Trials on the current array of computer‐aided designed/computer‐assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) bar attachment systems are encouraged. Plain language summary Attachments for implant dentures Review question The aim of this review was to assess different attachments used for upper or lower jaw implant dentures with respect to their success, wear and tear, patient satisfaction, patient preference and cost. Background For adults with complete tooth loss, the modern approach is implant dentures with attachment systems connecting the implants to the undersurface of the dentures. It is important to do the review as the choice of the number of implants and the design of the attachments influences prosthesis success, the amount of wear and tear, patient satisfaction, preference and costs. Study characteristics Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 24 January 2018. A total of six trials on adults with complete tooth loss were included with a total of 294 lower jaw dentures (anchored by one or more implants). The review looked at different attachment systems on the same implant systems. The six trials did not each evaluate the same attachment systems. There were no eligible trials with upper jaw implant dentures. Key results There is insufficient evidence to determine any significant differences between lower jaw implant denture attachment systems and an absence of evidence for upper jaw implant denture attachment systems. Further randomised controlled trials on people with complete tooth loss wearing dentures must pay specific attention to trial design using the same implant system and the same number of implants, but different attachment systems to determine their longevity and patient preferences. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. In all the included trials there were relatively few participants and few events, and there were serious limitations in the trial designs with data missing or not all outcomes reported.	10.1002/14651858.CD008001.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	472	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008001.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Penile rehabilitation for postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction	Philippou YAJ, J. H.  Steggall, M. J.  O'Driscoll, S. T.  Bakker, C. J.  Bodie, J. A.  Dahm, P.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Despite efforts to preserve the neurovascular bundles with nerve‐sparing surgery, erectile dysfunction remains common following radical prostatectomy. Postoperative penile rehabilitation seeks to restore erectile function but results have been conflicting. Objectives To evaluate the effects of penile rehabilitation strategies in restoring erectile function following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and a grey literature repository (Grey Literature Report) from their inception through to 3 January 2018. We also searched the reference lists of other relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised trials with a parallel or cross‐over design. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence according to GRADE on a per‐outcome basis. Primary outcomes were self‐reported potency, erectile function measured by validated questionnaires (with potency defined as an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF‐EF) score of 19 or greater and or an IIEF‐5 of score of 17 or greater) and serious adverse events. For all quality of life assessments on a continuous scale, higher values indicated better quality of life. Main results We included eight randomised controlled trials with 1699 participants across three comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of this review only. Scheduled phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) versus placebo or no treatment Scheduled PDE5I may have little or no effect on short‐term (up to 12 months) self‐reported potency (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to1.41; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 47 more men with self‐reported potency per 1000 (95% CI 33 fewer to 149 more) and short‐term erectile function as assessed by a validated instrument (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 28 more men per 1000 (95% CI 50 fewer to 138 more), but we are very uncertain of both of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in fewer serious adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; low quality evidence), though this does not appear biologically plausible and may represent a chance finding. We are also very uncertain of this finding. We found no long‐term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes. Scheduled PDE5I versus on‐demand PDE5I Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in both short‐term and long‐term (greater than 12 months) self‐reported potency (short term: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.53; long term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.67; both very low quality evidence); this corresponds to nine fewer men with self‐reported short‐term potency per 1000 (95% CI 119 fewer to 166 more) and zero fewer men with self‐reported long‐term potency per 1000 (95% CI 153 fewer to 257 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in short‐term and long‐term erectile function (short term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.55; long term; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14; both very‐low quality evidence), which corresponds to zero men with short‐term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 80 fewer to 125 more) and 119 fewer men with long‐term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 239 fewer to 64 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in little or no effects on short‐term adverse events (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.12 to 4.04; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to seven fewer men with short‐term serious adverse events (95% CI 1 fewer to 64 more), but we are very uncertain of these findings. We found no long‐term data for serious adverse events. Scheduled PDE5I versus scheduled intraurethral prostaglandin E1 At short‐term follow‐up, daily PDE5I may result in little or no effect on self‐reported potency (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79, to 1.52; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 46 more men per 1000 (95% CI 97 fewer to 241 more). Daily PDE5I may result in a small improvement of erectile function (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.20; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 92 more men per 1000 (95% CI 23 fewer to 318 more) but we are very uncertain of both these findings. We found no long‐term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes. We found no evidence for any other comparisons and were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on nerve‐sparing approach, age or baseline erectile function. Authors' conclusions Based on mostly very‐low and some low‐quality evidence, penile rehabilitation strategies consisting of scheduled PDE5I use following radical prostatectomy may not promote self‐reported potency and erectile function any more than on demand use. Plain language summary Penile rehabilitation for post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction Review question How well do treatments work to restore men's ability to have erections after surgery for prostate cancer? Background Many men have problems with erections after having their prostate removed for prostate cancer. Studies suggest that taking certain medicines or using devices to help with erection may help men's erections recover faster and better when used on a regular, scheduled basis (like daily or twice a week) rather than as needed. However, it is unclear how well these treatments actually work. Study characteristics We included eight randomised studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1699 participants. Five trials compared the scheduled use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (a type of medicine) to either no treatment or a placebo (a pretend drug with no effect). Two studies compared the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors either as a daily prescription or as needed. One study compared the daily use of either a phosphodiesterase inhibitor or a medicine called prostaglandin E1 that is placed into the tip of the penis like a suppository. The main outcomes of this review that we felt were most important to men were how good they thought their erections were (self‐reported potency), how good their erections were based on a specialised erection questionnaire (quality of erections) and any whether there were any major unwanted side effects. Key results We found that the men who used these medicines on a scheduled basis may have had similar self‐reported erections and quality of erections (based on questionnaires they filled out) as men who took no medication regularly or use it as needed. They also had similar rates of serious unwanted side effects and similar rates of stopping the drug before the end of the treatment duration. However, we are very uncertain of these findings. We were unable to research whether these results would be different in different groups of men based on whether the surgeon tried to preserve the nerves that help with erections or not, based on men's age and how good their erections were beforehand because we found no studies. Reliability of evidence The quality of evidence was very low for most main outcomes. That means we are very uncertain of the results of this review. Further research will likely change these findings.	10.1002/14651858.CD012414.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	510	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012414.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Prokinetics for functional dyspepsia	Pittayanon RY, Y.  Bollegala, N. P.  Khanna, R.  Leontiadis, G. I.  Moayyedi, P.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Dyspepsia is a common condition associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Prokinetics are the treatment of choice for functional dyspepsia (FD). However, the role of prokinetics in FD treatment is still controversial. Objectives We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomised control trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of prokinetics in the treatment of FD. The primary outcome was overall absence of or improvement of symptoms and symptom scores at the end of treatment. We also evaluated quality of life (QoL) and adverse events as secondary outcomes. Search methods We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL, from 1946 until September 2017. RevMan 5.3 was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) of symptoms persisting or without improved QoL or adverse events, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) of post‐treatment symptoms scores, changes of symptom scores, and QoL, when appropriate with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a random‐effects model. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methodology. Selection criteria We included studies that were parallel group RCTs comparing one prokinetic with either placebo or another prokinetic of the same or different class for the treatment of FD. Studies involved adults who presented with dyspepsia symptoms and who had negative or insignificant findings on endoscopy as well as no other organic and metabolic disorders. Studies only including participants with primarily reflux or heartburn symptoms were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, study quality and performed data extraction. Main results From an initial 1388 citations, we identified 43 studies in 40 papers. Of those, 29 studies with 10,044 participants compared six prokinetics with placebo for the outcome of absence of symptoms or symptom improvement. There was a statistically significant effect of prokinetic treatment in reducing global symptoms of FD (RR of remaining dyspeptic = 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) =7, very low‐quality evidence) with considerable heterogeneity; I 2 = 91% (P < 0.00001). After removing cisapride from the analysis, the effect of prokinetics in global symptom improvement still persisted, compared to placebo (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94), but was still based on very low‐quality evidence. The result showed persistence of significant improvement in subgroups of studies at unclear or at low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80‐0.92), and in subgroups by molecules of cisapride (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93; NNTB = 4), acotiamide (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98; NNTB = 20) and tegaserod(RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96; NNTB = 14). Ten studies compared different types of prokinetics with each other and the most commonly used comparator was domperidone, 10 mg three times a day (eight of the 10 studies). There was a significantly better post‐treatment symptom score in other prokinetics, compared to domperidone (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.03, very low‐quality evidence), but no difference in reducing global symptom (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07), and mean difference symptom scores (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.05). We found five studies that assessed quality of life, but there was no benefit in improving quality of life with prokinetic treatment (SMD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.33; participants = 1774). The adverse events in individual prokinetics was not different from placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.25; participants = 3811; studies = 17). However, when we looked at the adverse effects by each prokinetic, there were overall greater adverse effects in the active treatment group with cisapride (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.65; P = 0.03). The most common side effects were diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and nausea. The funnel plot was asymmetric (Egger's test, P = 0.02) implying reporting bias or other small‐study effects may be, in part, driv ng the benefit of prokinetics compared to placebo in this meta‐analysis. The GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence in each outcome are mostly low or very low due to concerns around risk of bias in study design, unexplained heterogeneity and possible publication bias. Authors' conclusions Due to low, or very low, quality of evidence, we are unable to say whether prokinetics are effective for the treatment of functional dyspepsia . We are uncertain which of the individual prokinetic drugs is the most effective as well as whether prokinetics can improve quality of life. Apart from cisapride, prokinetics are well‐tolerated. Good quality RCTs are needed to verify the efficacy of prokinetics. Plain language summary Medications which promote stomach movement to relieve upper abdominal discomfort that does not have a specific cause Background Functional dyspepsia occurs in people with upper abdominal discomfort that does not have an obvious, specific cause. Prokinetics may help people with functional dyspepsia, by promoting stomach movement. Study characteristics We included 43 studies that compared prokinetics with either placebo (powder that has the appearance similar to drug) or another prokinetic for treatment of functional dyspepsia. The studies were limited to those which assessed only adults who presented with upper abdominal discomfort but who did not have a specific cause after investigation. Key results We are uncertain whether prokinetics reduce dyspeptic symptoms, compared to no prokinetic treatment. We are also uncertain which prokinetics had the most efficacy in reducing dyspeptic symptoms, improving post‐treatment symptom scores, or improving the mean difference of symptom score. We are uncertain whether prokinetic treatment can improve quality of life. We are uncertain whether prokinetics (except cisapride) differ from no prokinetic in producing unpleasant symptoms. The most common unpleasant symptoms from prokinetics were diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and nausea. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was graded as low or very low. We need more research to prove the benefit of prokinetics for treatment in people with functional dyspepsia.	10.1002/14651858.CD009431.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	519	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009431.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Eszopiclone for insomnia	Rösner SE, C.  Wehrle, R.  Hajak, G.  Soyka, M.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Insomnia is a major public health issue affecting between 6% to 10% of the adult population in Western countries. Eszopiclone is a hypnotic drug belonging to a newer group of hypnotic agents, known as new generation hypnotics, which was marketed as being just as effective as benzodiazepines for this condition, while being safer and having a lower risk for abuse and dependence. It is the aim of the review to integrate evidence from randomised controlled trials and to draw conclusions on eszopiclone's efficacy and safety profile, while taking methodological features and bias risks into consideration. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia compared to placebo or active control. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and registry databases (WHO trials portal, ClinicalTrials.gov) with results incorporated from searches to 10 February 2016. To identify trials not registered in electronic databases, we contacted key informants and searched reference lists of identified studies. We ran an update search (21 February 2018) and have placed studies of interest in awaiting classification/ongoing studies. These will be incorporated into the next version of the review, as appropriate. Selection criteria Parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eszopiclone with either placebo or active control were included in the review. Participants were adults with insomnia, as diagnosed with a standardised diagnostic system, including primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted outcome data; one reviewer assessed trial quality and the second author cross‐checked it. Main results A total of 14 RCTs, with 4732 participants, were included in this review covering short‐term (≤ 4 weeks; 6 studies), medium‐term (> 4 weeks ≤ 6 months; 6 studies) and long‐term treatment (> 6 months; 2 studies) with eszopiclone. Most RCTs included in the review included participants aged between 18 and 64 years, three RCTs only included elderly participants (64 to 85 years) and one RCT included participants with a broader age range (35 to 85 years). Seven studies considered primary insomnia; the remaining studies considered secondary insomnia comorbid with depression (2), generalised anxiety (1), back pain (1), Parkinson's disease (1), rheumatoid arthritis (1) and menopausal transition (1). Meta‐analytic integrations of participant‐reported data on sleep efficacy outcomes demonstrated better results for eszopiclone compared to placebo: a 12‐minute decrease of sleep onset latency (mean difference (MD) ‐11.94 min, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐16.03 to ‐7.86; 9 studies, 2890 participants, moderate quality evidence), a 17‐minute decrease of wake time after sleep onset (MD ‐17.02 min, 95% CI ‐24.89 to ‐9.15; 8 studies, 2295 participants, moderate quality evidence) and a 28‐minute increase of total sleep time (MD 27.70 min, 95% CI 20.30 to 35.09; 10 studies, 2965 participants, moderate quality evidence). There were no significant changes from baseline to the first three nights after drug discontinuation for sleep onset latency (MD 17.00 min, 95% CI ‐4.29 to 38.29; 1 study, 291 participants, low quality evidence) and wake time after sleep onset (MD ‐6.71 min, 95% CI ‐21.25 to 7.83; 1 study, 291 participants, low quality evidence). Adverse events during treatment that were documented more frequently under eszopiclone compared to placebo included unpleasant taste (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.21; 9 studies, 3787 participants), dry mouth (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 6 studies, 2802 participants), somnolence (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 8 studies, 3532 participants) and dizziness (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; 7 studies, 2933 participants). According to the GRADE criteria, evidence was rated as being of moderate quality for sleep efficacy outcomes and adverse events and of low quality or rebound effects and next‐day functioning. Authors' conclusions Eszopiclone appears to be an efficient drug with moderate effects on sleep onset and maintenance. There was no or little evidence of harm if taken as recommended. However, as certain patient subgroups were underrepresented in RCTs included in the review, findings might not have displayed the entire spectrum of possible adverse events. Further, increased caution is required in elderly individuals with cognitive and motor impairments and individuals who are at increased risk of using eszopiclone in a non‐recommended way. Plain language summary Eszopiclone (Lunesta) for sleep difficulty Why is this review important? Insomnia is the medical term for sleep difficulty covering trouble falling asleep, difficulties staying asleep, waking up too early or experiencing sleep as non‐restorative. Insomnia can be treated with different methods including behaviour modification, relaxation techniques, or sleeping medication. Eszopiclone (Lunesta) is a sleeping medication that belongs to a class of sleeping tablets known as non‐benzodiazepine hypnotics. Who will be interested in this review? People who are affected by insomnia, general practitioners, professionals working in health services, and addiction treatment and health policy makers. What questions does this review aim to answer? The review aimed to find out more about the wanted effects and unwanted effects of eszopiclone. Wanted effects included the immediate effects eszopiclone has on sleep; unwanted effects included side effects, effects on next‐day functioning, but also addictive properties of the drug. Which studies were included in the review? The review summarised findings from 14 clinical studies with 4732 people, either receiving eszopiclone or an identically‐appearing, but inert substance (placebo). What does the evidence from the review tell us? On average, people taking eszopiclone fell asleep 12 minutes faster than those taking placebo, were 17 minutes less awake during the night and had, in total, about half an hour more sleep than people in the placebo group. As side effects, eszopiclone can cause unpleasant taste, dizziness, dry mouth, and tiredness during the day. Clinical studies did not find evidence that eszopiclone was causing serious harm or withdrawal symptoms or whether it was addictive if it was stopped and not taken after several weeks or months of treatment. Nevertheless, as clinical studies included in the review did not cover certain groups (e.g. elderly people with cognitive or motor problems or certain conditions of medication intake), it is important for patients to consult their doctor who knows their medical history and condition. What should happen next? Future research needs to compare eszopiclone with other sleep medications to help physicians and patients decide which of the available treatment options to prefer. In addition, sleep medications that are also well tolerated by elderly individuals and individuals with alcohol or drug problems need to be identified.	10.1002/14651858.CD010703.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	526	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010703.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Taxane‐based chemohormonal therapy for metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer	Sathianathen NJP, Y. A.  Kuntz, G. M.  Konety, B. R.  Gupta, S.  Lamb, A. D.  Dahm, P.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background There has been considerable development in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer over the last decade. A number of agents, including docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide and sipuleucel‐T, have been reported to improve outcomes in men with castration‐resistant disease and their use is being explored in hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. Objectives To assess the effects of early taxane‐based chemohormonal therapy for newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 10 August 2018. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. Selection criteria We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials in which participants were administered taxane‐based chemotherapy with systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 120 days of beginning ADT versus ADT alone at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. Main results The search identified three studies in which 2,261 participants were randomized to receive either ADT alone, or taxane‐based chemotherapy at a dose of 75mg per square meter of body surface area at three‐weekly intervals for six or nine cycles in addition to ADT. Primary outcomes Early treatment with taxane‐based chemotherapy in addition to ADT probably reduces death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.87; moderate‐certainty evidence); this would result in 94 fewer deaths per 1,000 men (95% CI 51 to 137 fewer deaths). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations related to potential performance bias. Based on the results of one study with 375 participants, the addition of taxane‐based chemotherapy to ADT may increase the incidence of Grade III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio (RR) 2.98, 95% CI 2.19 to 4.04; low‐certainty evidence); this would result in 405 more Grade III to V adverse events per 1,000 men (95% CI 243 to 621 more events). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes Early taxane‐based chemotherapy in addition to ADT probably reduces the risk of prostate cancer‐specific death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; moderate‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations related to potential performance and detection bias. The addition of taxane‐based chemotherapy also probably reduces disease progression compared to ADT alone (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.71; moderate‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations related to potential performance bias. The addition of taxane‐based chemotherapy to ADT may result in a large increase in the risk of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 79.41, 95% CI 4.92 to 1282.78; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations and imprecision. This estimate is derived from a single study with no events in the control arm but a discontinuation rate of 20% in the intervention arm. Taxane‐based chemotherapy may increase the incidence of adverse events of any grade (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded our assessment of the certainty of evidence due to very serious study limitations. There may be a small improvement, which may not be clinically important, in quality of life at 12 months with combination treatment (mean difference (MD) 2.85 on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Prostate scale, 95% CI 0.13 highe to 5.57 higher; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations related to potential performance, detection and attrition bias. Authors' conclusions Compared to ADT alone, the early (within 120 days of beginning ADT) addition of taxane‐based chemotherapy to ADT for hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer probably prolongs both overall and disease‐specific survival and delays disease progression. There may be an increase in toxicity with taxane‐based chemotherapy in combination with ADT. There may also be a small, clinically unimportant improvement in quality of life at 12 months with taxane‐based chemotherapy and ADT treatment. Plain language summary Adding taxane‐based chemotherapy to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer Review question The aim of this review was to find out if adding taxane‐based chemotherapy to hormone therapy improved outcomes in men with metastatic, hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies. Background Of the men diagnosed with prostate cancer, approximately 16% will present with cancer that has spread at diagnosis. In addition, another 15% to 30% of men will get the disease again after having primary treatment. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the first treatment for advanced cancer but it does not cure it and eventually the cancer comes back. Recently studies have looked at whether chemotherapy (chemicals that kill cancer cells), when given early, improve how patients do. Study characteristics The evidence is current to August 2018. We found three studies (specifically, randomized controlled trials) with a total of 2,261 people. The studies compared docetaxel (an anti‐cancer drug) and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. Key results Taxane‐based chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy likely improves overall and cancer‐specific survival and reduces disease progression. There may also be a small but unimportant improvement in quality of life at 12 months. There may also be an increase in side effects when people are treated with taxane‐based chemotherapy. Certainty of evidence We judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for time‐to‐death from any cause, risk of prostate cancer‐specific death and the time to disease progression. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the truth, but there were limitations in the studies that reduce our confidence in the results. The certainty of the evidence was low for Grade III to V adverse events (side effects), adverse events of all grades, people stopping treatment due to adverse events, and quality of life. This means that the true effect of the treatment may be substantially different from what this review shows, because of limitations in the studies and imprecision (variability in estimates).	10.1002/14651858.CD012816.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	524	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012816.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Charbek, E.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]	*Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Administration, Inhalation  Amikacin [administration & dosage]  Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]  Carbenicillin [administration & dosage]  Ceftazidime [administration & dosage]  Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]  Disease Progression  Humans  Injections, Intravenous  Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]  Respiratory Tract Infections [drug therapy, microbiology]  Ticarcillin [administration & dosage]  Tobramycin [administration & dosage]	[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder in which abnormal mucus in the lungs is associated with susceptibility to persistent infection. Pulmonary exacerbations are when symptoms of infection become more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment for exacerbations and inhaled antibiotics may be used alone or in conjunction with oral antibiotics for milder exacerbations or with intravenous antibiotics for more severe infections. Inhaled antibiotics do not cause the same adverse effects as intravenous antibiotics and may prove an alternative in people with poor access to their veins. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine if treatment of pulmonary exacerbations with inhaled antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis improves their quality of life, reduces time off school or work and improves their long‐term survival. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. Date of the last search: 03 October 2018. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and WHO ICTRP for relevant trials. Date of last search: 09 October 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis with a pulmonary exacerbation in whom treatment with inhaled antibiotics was compared to placebo, standard treatment or another inhaled antibiotic for between one and four weeks. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted data. They assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Authors of the included trials were contacted for more information. Main results Four trials with 167 participants are included in the review. Two trials (77 participants) compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone and two trials (90 participants) compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone. Trials were heterogenous in design and two were only available in abstract form. Risk of bias was difficult to assess in most trials, but for all trials we judged there to be a high risk from lack of blinding and an unclear risk with regards to randomisation. Results were not fully reported and only limited data were available for analysis. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone Only one trial (n = 18) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle (quality of life) in both groups (very low‐quality of evidence). Neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but there was no difference reported between treatment groups (very low‐quality evidence). With regards to our secondary outcomes, one trial (n = 18) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (n = 59) reported on the time to next exacerbation. In neither case was a difference between treatments identified (both very low‐quality evidence). The single trial (n = 18) measuring adverse events and sputum microbiology did not observe any in either treatment group for either outcome (very low‐quality evidence). Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone Neither trial reported on quality of life or time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but found no difference between groups in forced expiratory volume in one second (one trial, n = 28, very low‐quality evidence) or vital capacity (one trial, n = 62). Neither trial reported on the need for additional antibiotics or the time to the next exacerbation; however, one trial (n = 28) reported on hospital admissions and found no difference between groups. Both trials reported no difference between groups in adverse events (very low‐quality evidence) and one trial (n = 62) reported no difference in the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant organisms (very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is little useful high‐level evidence to judge the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. The included trials were not sufficiently powered to achieve their goals. Hence, we are unable to demonstrate whether one treatment was superior to the other or not. Further research is needed to establish whether inhaled tobramycin may be used as an alternative to intravenous tobramycin for some pulmonary exacerbations. Plain language summary Inhaling antibiotics to treat temporary worsening of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for inhaling antibiotics to treat exacerbations (flare ups) of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that results in abnormally sticky mucus in several parts of the body. In the lungs the sticky mucus can lead to repeated infection. An exacerbation makes the symptoms more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment and may be given by mouth, by needle into the blood stream or by inhaling the drug. We wanted to learn if inhaling antibiotics improved general health compared to the other methods. This might mean that people with cystic fibrosis could avoid hospitalisation for intravenous antibiotics and some side effects. Inhaling the antibiotics would also be easier for people who have difficulty with access to their veins. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 October 2018. Study characteristics We found four trials with a total of 167 participants, two of which compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone (77 participants) and two which compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone (90 participants) for treating exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. In all trials the inhaled antibiotics were compared to the same antibiotics given intravenously. The numbers of participants in each trial ranged from 18 to 62. Key results Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone One trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle in both groups but neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but neither reported any difference between treatment groups. One trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the time to next exacerbation ‐ there was no difference between inhaled or intravenous antibiotics for either outcome. Only one trial (18 participants) measured adverse events and sputum microbiology, but did not find any difference between treatments for either outcome. Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone Neither trial reported on quality of life or time off work or school. Both trials reported lung function, but found no difference between groups. Neither trial reported on the need for additional antibiotics or the time to the next exacerbation; however, one trial (28 participants) reported on hospital admissions and found no difference between groups. Both trials reported no difference between groups in adverse events and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant organisms. Quality of the evidence We graded the quality of the evidence as very low. We had concerns since none of the trials stated how the participants were diagnosed with CF or how they defined an exacerbation. It was not possible to keep the treatment group secret from the participants as the trials compared different ways of giving the antibiotics and we thought this would likely influence some of the results. We were not sure whether the participants were put into the different groups truly at random and we do not know how this might affect the results.	10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub3	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	528	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub3	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	One‐to‐one oral hygiene advice provided in a dental setting for oral health	Soldani FAL, T.  Jones, K.  Young, L.  Walsh, T.  Lala, R.  Clarkson, J. E.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Effective oral hygiene measures carried out on a regular basis are vital to maintain good oral health. One‐to‐one oral hygiene advice (OHA) within the dental setting is often provided as a means to motivate individuals and to help achieve improved levels of oral health. However, it is unclear if one‐to‐one OHA in a dental setting is effective in improving oral health and what method(s) might be most effective and efficient. Objectives To assess the effects of one‐to‐one OHA, provided by a member of the dental team within the dental setting, on patients' oral health, hygiene, behaviour, and attitudes compared to no advice or advice in a different format. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 10 November 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library (searched 10 November 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 November 2017); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 10 November 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched for ongoing trials (10 November 2017). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Reference lists of relevant articles and previously published systematic reviews were handsearched. The authors of eligible trials were contacted, where feasible, to identify any unpublished work. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of one‐to‐one OHA delivered by a dental care professional in a dental care setting with a minimum of 8 weeks follow‐up. We included healthy participants or participants who had a well‐defined medical condition. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors carried out selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias independently and in duplicate. Consensus was achieved by discussion, or involvement of a third review author if required. Main results Nineteen studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review with data available for a total of 4232 participants. The included studies reported a wide variety of interventions, study populations, clinical outcomes and outcome measures. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies and it was not deemed appropriate to pool data in a meta‐analysis. We summarised data by categorising similar interventions into comparison groups. Comparison 1: Any form of one‐to‐one OHA versus no OHA Four studies compared any form of one‐to‐one OHA versus no OHA. Two studies reported the outcome of gingivitis. Although one small study had contradictory results at 3 months and 6 months, the other study showed very low‐quality evidence of a benefit for OHA at all time points (very low‐quality evidence). The same two studies reported the outcome of plaque. There was low‐quality evidence that these interventions showed a benefit for OHA in plaque reduction at all time points. Two studies reported the outcome of dental caries at 6 months and 12 months respectively. There was very low‐quality evidence of a benefit for OHA at 12 months. Comparison 2: Personalised one‐to‐one OHA versus routine one‐to‐one OHA Four studies compared personalised OHA versus routine OHA. There was little evidence available that any of these interventions demonstrated a difference on the outcomes of gingivitis, plaque or dental caries (very low quality). Comparison 3: Self‐management versus professional OHA Five trials compared some form of self‐management with some form of professional OHA. There was little evidence available that any of these interventions demonstrated a difference on the outcomes of gingivitis or plaque (very low quality). None of the studies measured dental caries. Comparison 4: Enhanced one‐to‐one OHA versus one‐to‐one OHA Seven trials compared some form of enhanced OHA w th some form of routine OHA. There was little evidence available that any of these interventions demonstrated a difference on the outcomes of gingivitis, plaque or dental caries (very low quality). Authors' conclusions There was insufficient high‐quality evidence to recommend any specific one‐to‐one OHA method as being effective in improving oral health or being more effective than any other method. Further high‐quality randomised controlled trials are required to determine the most effective, efficient method of one‐to‐one OHA for oral health maintenance and improvement. The design of such trials should be cognisant of the limitations of the available evidence presented in this Cochrane Review. Plain language summary One‐to‐one oral hygiene advice for oral health Review question The aim of this review was to assess the effects of one‐to‐one oral hygiene advice, provided by a member of the dental team within the dental setting, on patients' oral health, hygiene, behaviour, and attitudes compared to no advice or advice in a different format. Background Poor oral hygiene habits are known to be associated with high rates of dental decay and gum disease. The dental team routinely assess oral hygiene methods, frequency and effectiveness or otherwise of oral hygiene routines carried out by their patients; one‐to‐one oral hygiene advice is regularly provided by members of the dental team with the aim of motivating individuals and improving their oral health. The most effective method of delivering one‐to‐one advice in the dental setting is unclear. This review's aim is to determine if providing patients with one‐to‐one oral hygiene advice in the dental setting is effective and if so what is the best way to deliver this advice. Study characteristics Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 10 November 2017. We included research where individual patients received oral hygiene advice from a dental care professional on a one‐to‐one basis in a dental clinic setting with a minimum of 8 weeks follow‐up. In total, within the identified 19 studies, oral hygiene advice was provided by a hygienist in eight studies, dentist in four studies, dental nurse in one study, dentist or hygienist in one study, dental nurse and hygienist in one study, and dental nurse oral hygiene advice to the control group with further self‐administration of the intervention in one study. It was unclear in three of the studies which member of the dental team carried out the intervention. Over half of the studies (10 of the 19) were conducted in a hospital setting, with only five studies conducted in a general dental practice setting (where oral hygiene advice is largely delivered). Key results Overall we found insufficient evidence to recommend any specific method of one‐ to‐one oral hygiene advice as being more effective than another in maintaining or improving oral health. The studies we found varied considerably in how the oral hygiene advice was delivered, by whom and what outcomes were looked at. Due to this it was difficult to readily compare these studies and further well designed studies should be conducted to give a more accurate conclusion as to the most effective method of maintaining or improving oral health through one‐to‐one oral hygiene advice delivered by a dental care professional in a dental setting. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to problems with the design of the studies.	10.1002/14651858.CD007447.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	489	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007447.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Extended‐field radiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer	Thamronganantasakul KS, N.  Kietpeerakool, C.  Pattanittum, P.  Lumbiganon, P.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background The para‐aortic lymph nodes (located along the major vessels in the mid and upper abdomen) are a common place for disease recurrence after treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. The para‐aortic area is not covered by standard pelvic radiotherapy fields and so treatment to the pelvis alone is inadequate for women at a high risk of occult cancer within para‐aortic lymph nodes. Extended‐field radiotherapy (RT) widens the pelvic RT field to include the para‐aortic lymph node area. Extended‐field RT may improve outcomes in women with locally advanced cervical cancer by treating occult disease in para‐aortic nodes not identified at pretreatment imaging. However, RT treatment of the para‐aortic area can cause severe adverse effects, so may increase harms. Studies of pelvic chemoradiotherapy (CRT) demonstrated improved survival rates compared to pelvic RT alone. CRT is now the standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. Studies comparing pelvic RT alone (without concurrent chemotherapy) with extended‐field RT should therefore be viewed with caution, since they compare treatments against what is now substandard treatment (pelvic RT alone). This review should therefore be read with this in mind and comparisons with pelvic RT cannot be extrapolated to pelvic CRT. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of extended‐field radiotherapy in women undergoing first‐line treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 7), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to August week 4, 2018), and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2018, week 35). We checked registers of clinical trials, grey literature, conference reports, and citation lists of included studies to August 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of extended‐field RT for locally advanced cervical cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant RCTs, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and made judgements on the quality and certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or consultation with a third review author. Main results Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Three included studies compared extended‐field RT versus pelvic RT, one included study compared extended‐field RT with pelvic CRT, and one study compared extended‐field CRT versus pelvic CRT. Extended‐field radiotherapy versus pelvic radiotherapy alone   Compared to pelvic RT, extended‐field RT probably reduces the risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.94; 1 study; 337 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and para‐aortic lymph node recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.70; 2 studies; 477 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), although there may or may not have been improvement in the risk of disease progression (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22; 1 study; 337 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and severe adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.41; 2 studies; 776 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Extended‐field radiotherapy versus pelvic chemoradiotherapy   In a comparison of extended‐field RT versus pelvic CRT, women given pelvic CRT probably had a lower risk of death (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64; 1 study; 389 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and disease progression (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.72; 1 study; 389 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Participants given extended‐field RT may or may not have had a lower risk of para‐aortic lymph node recurrence (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.99; 1 study; 389 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and acute severe adverse events (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; 1 study; 388 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in terms of late severe adverse events among the comparison groups (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.62; 1 study; 386 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Extended‐field chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic chemoradiotherapy   Very low‐certainty evidence obtained from one small study (74 participants) showed that, compared to pelvic CRT, extended‐field CRT may or may not have reduced risk of death (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.96) and disease progression (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.87). There were no clear differences between the groups in the risks of para‐aortic lymph node recurrence (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.54; very low‐certainty evidence) and severe adverse events (acute: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.39; late: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.59; very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that, compared with pelvic RT alone, extended‐field RT probably improves overall survival and reduces risk of para‐aortic lymph node recurrence. However, pelvic RT alone would now be considered substandard treatment, so this result cannot be extrapolated to modern standards of care. Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that pelvic CRT may increase overall and progression‐free survival compared to extended‐field RT, although there may or may not be a higher rate of para‐aortic recurrence and acute adverse events. Extended‐field CRT versus pelvic CRT may improve overall or progression‐free survival, but these findings should be interpreted with caution due to very low‐certainty evidence. High‐quality RCTs, comparing modern treatment techniques in CRT, are needed to more fully inform treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer without obvious para‐aortic node involvement. Plain language summary Does extended‐field radiotherapy reduce death from locally advanced cervical cancer and what are the side effects? The issue   Radiotherapy (RT) to the pelvis is used to treat cervical cancer. However, pelvic RT will not treat cancer that has spread to para‐aortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes lying along main blood vessels in the mid and upper stomach), since these are outside the target area (field) of RT. Extended‐field RT targets areas containing both pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes. Widening the RT field to include the para‐aortic area may reduce the risk of cancer returning. Chemotherapy is now normally given at the same time as RT for the treatment of cervical cancer (concurrent chemotherapy) and the combine treatment is called chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This is now standard treatment because studies have shown that addition of chemotherapy during RT improved survival for women with cervical cancer thought to be confined to the pelvis. Older studies, which compared treatments with pelvic RT alone, would not now be considered the standard of care for women well enough to have CRT. We cannot assume that results from studies which compared extended‐field RT with pelvic RT apply to modern CRT treatments. The aim of this review   In women with locally advanced cervical cancer, does extending the RT field to cover the para‐aortic area reduce the risk of death from cervical cancer and what are the harms? Study characteristics   We searched databases from their inception to August 2018 and found five studies that met the inclusion criteria. Three studies compared extended‐field RT versus pelvic RT. None of these three studies compared against the current gold‐standard of pelvic CRT. One study compared extended‐field RT versus pelvic CRT and one study compared extended‐field CRT versus pelvic CRT. What were the main findings?   Compared with pelvic RT alone, women given extended‐field RT may have been less likely to die and probably were less likely to have a cervical cancer come back (recurrence) in the para‐aortic lymph nodes. However, extended‐field RT may have made little or no difference to how often their cancer recurred elsewhere and how often they experience severe side effects. Pelvic CRT is the modern standard of treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. In a compari on of extended‐field RT alone versus pelvic CRT, women given pelvic CRT were probably less likely to die or have recurrence of their cancer. Women given extended‐field RT alone may have been less likely to experience a recurrence within the para‐aortic lymph nodes and have had adverse events during or shortly after treatment. There were no clear differences regarding the late adverse events between the two groups. Women given extended‐field CRT may or may not have been less likely to die or have cancer progression than those women pelvic CRT. There were no clear differences in the chances of experiencing a cancer recurrence in the para‐aortic lymph nodes and severe side effects between the groups. Certainty of the evidence   The evidence for outcomes in the comparison of extended‐field RT alone versus pelvic RT alone were of moderate certainty. In the comparison of extended‐field RT versus pelvic CRT, the evidence regarding the survival and side effects were of moderate certainty. The evidence for para‐aortic recurrence was of low certainty. The evidence for all outcomes in a comparison of extended‐field CRT versus pelvic CRT were of very‐low certainty because of concerns regarding the high risk of bias and results coming from a single trial of very few women. What were the conclusions?   We are moderately certain that, compared with pelvic RT alone, extended‐field RT probably improves overall survival and reduces risk of para‐aortic lymph node recurrence. However, pelvic RT alone would now not be considered the standard of care in women well enough to receive CRT, so these results should be reviewed with caution and cannot be extrapolated to modern treatment techniques. Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence supports the use of pelvic CRT rather than extended‐field RT alone, as it appears to reduce the risk of death and cancer progression. The likelihood of experiencing unwanted side effects during treatment was higher among women receiving pelvic CRT than extended‐field RT. Evidence comparing extended‐field CRT to pelvic CRT was very low certainty regarding outcomes and it may or may not improve survival.	10.1002/14651858.CD012301.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	532	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012301.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

Antiangiogenic therapy with anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) can reduce oedema, improve vision and prevent further visual loss. These drugs have replaced laser photocoagulation as the standard of care for people with DMO. Objectives The 2014 update of this review found high‐quality evidence of benefit with anti‐VEGF modalities, compared to laser photocoagulation, for the treatment of DMO. The objective of this updated review is to compare the effectiveness and safety of the different anti‐VEGF drugs using network meta‐analysis methods. Search methods We searched various electronic databases on 26 April 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any anti‐angiogenic drug with an anti‐VEGF mechanism of action versus another anti‐VEGF drug, another treatment, sham or no treatment in people with DMO. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods for pair‐wise meta‐analysis and we augmented this evidence using network meta‐analysis methods. We focused on the relative efficacy and safety of the three most commonly used drugs as interventions of direct interest for practice: aflibercept and ranibizumab, used on‐label; and off‐label bevacizumab. We collected data on three efficacy outcomes (gain of 15 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters; mean change in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA); mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT)), three safety outcomes (all severe systemic adverse events (SSAEs); all‐cause death; arterial thromboembolic events) and quality of life. We used Stata ' network ' meta‐analysis package for all analyses. We investigated the risk of bias of mixed comparisons based on the variance contribution of each study, having assigned an overall risk of bias to each study. Main results Twenty‐four studies included 6007 participants with DMO and moderate vision loss, of which two studies randomised 265 eyes of 230 participants and one was a cross‐over study on 56 participants (62 eyes) that was treated as a parallel‐arm trial. Data were collected on drugs of direct interest from three studies on aflibercept (975 eyes), eight studies on bevacizumab (515 eyes), and 14 studies on ranibizumab (1518 eyes). As treatments of indirect interest or legacy treatment we included three studies on pegaptanib (541 eyes), five studies on ranibizumab plus prompt laser (557 eyes), one study on ranibizumab plus deferred laser (188 eyes), 13 studies on laser photocoagulation (936 eyes) and six studies on sham treatment (793 eyes). Aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab were all more effective than laser for improving vision by 3 or more lines after one year (high‐certainty evidence). Approximately one in 10 people improve vision with laser, and about three in 10 people improve with anti‐VEGF treatment: risk ratio (RR) versus laser 3.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.79 to 4.79) for aflibercept; RR 2.47 (95% CI 1.81 to 3.37) for bevacizumab; RR 2.76 (95% CI 2.12 to 3.59) for ranibizumab. On average there was no change in visual acuity (VA) with laser after one year, compared with a gain of 1 or 2 lines with anti‐VEGF treatment: laser versus aflibercept mean difference (MD) −0.20 (95% CI −0.22 to −0.17) logMAR; versus bevacizumab MD −0.12 (95% CI −0.15 to −0.09) logMAR; versus ranibizumab MD −0.12 (95% CI −0.14 to −0.10) logMAR. The certainty of the evidence was high for the comparison of aflibercept and ranibizumab with laser and moderate for bevacizumab comparison with laser due to inconsistency between the indirect and direct evidence. People receiving ranibizumab were less likely to gain 3 or more lines of VA at one year compared with aflibercept: RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.94), moderate‐certainty evidence. For every 1000 people treated with aflibercept, 92 fewer would gain 3 or more lines of VA at one year if treated with ranibizumab (22 to 148 f wer). On average people receiving ranibizumab had worse VA at one year (MD 0.08 logMAR units, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11), moderate‐certainty evidence; and higher CRT (MD 39 µm, 95% CI 2 µm to 76 µm; low‐certainty evidence). Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were comparable with respect to aflibercept and did not differ in terms of VA: RR of gain of 3 or more lines of VA at one year 1.11 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.43), moderate‐certainty evidence, and difference in change in VA was 0.00 (95% CI −0.02 to 0.03) logMAR, moderate‐certainty evidence. CRT reduction favoured ranibizumab by −29 µm (95% CI −58 µm to −1 µm, low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of overall statistical inconsistency in our analyses. The previous version of this review found moderate‐certainty evidence of good safety of antiangiogenic drugs versus control. This update used data at the longest available follow‐up (one or two years) and found that aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab do not differ regarding systemic serious adverse events (SSAEs) (moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence). However, risk of bias was variable, loop inconsistency could be found and estimates were not precise enough on relative safety regarding less frequent events such as arterial thromboembolic events or death (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). Two‐year data were available and reported in only four RCTs in this review. Most industry‐sponsored studies were open‐label after one year. One large publicly‐funded study compared the three drugs at two years and found no difference. Authors' conclusions Anti‐VEGF drugs are effective at improving vision in people with DMO with three to four in every 10 people likely to experience an improvement of 3 or more lines VA at one year. Aflibercept may confer some advantage over ranibizumab and bevacizumab in people with DMO at one year in visual and anatomic terms but it is unclear whether this applies to the long‐term. There is a need for more evidence on the long‐term (greater than two years) comparative effects of these anti‐VEGF agents. Evidence from RCTs may not apply to real‐world practice, where people in need of antiangiogenic treatment are often under‐treated and under‐monitored. We found no signals of differences in overall safety between the three antiangiogenic drugs that are currently available to treat DMO, but our estimates are imprecise for cardiovascular events and death. Plain language summary Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) drugs for diabetic macular oedema What is the aim of this review?   The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which is the best type of anti‐VEGF drug for diabetic macular oedema (DMO). Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 24 studies. Key messages   Anti‐VEGF drugs given by injection into the eye improve vision in people with diabetic macular oedema as compared to no average improvement with laser photocoagulation. One of these drugs, aflibercept, probably works slightly better after one year. There did not appear to be important harms from any of these drugs. What was studied in the review?   The light‐sensitive tissue at the back of the eye is known as the retina. The central area of the retina is called the macula. People with diabetes can develop problems in the retina, known as retinopathy. Some people with diabetic retinopathy can also develop oedema (swelling or thickening) at the macula. DMO is a common complication of diabetic retinopathy and can lead to visual loss. One type of treatment for DMO is anti‐VEGF. This drug is given by means of an injection into the eye. It can reduce the swelling at the back of the eye and prevent visual loss. There are three main types of anti‐VEGF drugs in use: aflibercept (Eyelea TM ), bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis TM ). Only aflibercept and ranibizumab have received marketing authorisation for the treatment of DMO. All three drugs are used to prevent visual loss and improve vision. T ey do this by slowing down the growth of new blood vessels and thereby reducing the swelling at the back of the eye. They may have adverse effects, particularly related to effects on blood vessels in the rest of the body. These effects may include stroke and heart attack. What are the main results of the review?   Cochrane researchers found 24 relevant studies. Fourteen of these studies were industry‐sponsored studies from USA, Europe or Asia. Ten studies were independent of industry funding and were from USA, Europe, Middle East and South America. These studies investigated ranibizumab, bevacizumab and aflibercept. These anti‐VEGF drugs were compared with no treatment, placebo treatment, laser treatment, or each other. The drugs were given every month, every two months, as needed or 'treat and extend', which means that the time period between treatments is extended if the condition has stabilised. Decisions about re‐treating were based on visual acuity or by looking at the back of the eye. The review reveals the following results. • All three anti‐VEGF drugs prevent visual loss and improve vision in people with DMO (high‐certainty evidence). • People receiving ranibizumab were probably slightly less likely to improve vision compared with aflibercept at one year after the start of treatment (moderate‐certainty evidence). Approximately three in 10 people improve vision by 3 or more lines with ranibizumab and one in 10 additional people can achieve this with aflibercept. • People receiving ranibizumab and bevacizumab probably have a similar visual outcome at one year after the start of treatment (moderate‐certainty evidence). • Aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab are similar for common and serious systemic harms (such as any disease leading to hospitalisation, disability or death) (moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence) but is less certain for arterial thromboembolic events (mainly stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death) and death of any cause (very low‐certainty evidence). How up to date is this review?   Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 26 April 2017.	10.1002/14651858.CD007419.pub6	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	469	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007419.pub6	[RelLinks]	[Imag]

However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain, as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results. Objectives To assess effects of antibiotics on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) for management of acute COPD exacerbations, as well as their effects on other patient‐important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay, time to next exacerbation). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other electronically available databases up to 26 September 2018. Selection criteria We sought to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo and providing follow‐up of at least seven days. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients, and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised as a single group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation, and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. When authors of primary studies did not report outcomes or study details, we contacted them to request missing data. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (ORs) for rare events (mortality and adverse events), and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes using random‐effects models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation. Main results We included 19 trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients, and one with ICU patients). For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277). Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%). Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30). One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re‐exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health‐related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups. Evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure among inpatients with severe exacerbations (i.e. for inpatients excluding ICU patients) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12; I² = 50%), but trial results remain uncertain. In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%). Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in antibiotic and placebo groups. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; moderate‐quality evidence; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 65 to 107 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 45 to 254). Results of this trial show a statistically significant effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72; moderate‐quality evidence) and on length of hospital stay (MD ‐9.60 days, 95% CI ‐12.84 to ‐6.36; low‐quality evidence). Evidence of moderate quality gathered from trials conducted in all settings shows no statistically significant effect on overall incidence of adverse events (Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.63; moderate‐quality evidence) nor on diarrhoea (Peto OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.07; moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Researchers have found that antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small, and they are inconsistent for some outcomes (treatment failure) and absent for other outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay). Analyses show a strong beneficial effect of antibiotics among ICU patients. Few data are available on the effects of antibiotics on health‐related quality of life or on other patient‐reported symptoms, and data show no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics, while sparing antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to experience benefit and for whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi‐resistance) should be avoided. Plain language summary Are antibiotics beneficial for flare‐ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Review question We conducted this systematic review to find out if the benefits of taking antibiotics for flare‐ups of COPD outweigh potential harms (e.g. risks of multi‐resistant bacteria for this population). Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition (most often caused by smoking or environmental exposure) that affects the passage of air into and out of the lungs. As a consequence, patients experience shortness of breath and coughing. Flare‐ups of COPD are a hallmark of more advanced stages of the disease. Flare‐ups are defined as sustained worsening of symptoms from the patient's usual stable state. Commonly reported symptoms include worsening breathlessness, cough, increased sputum production, and change in sputum colour. Clinicians frequently prescribe antibiotics for flare‐ups in patients with COPD, although the cause of flare‐ups is often difficult to determine (viral, bacterial, environmental). Study characteristics Evidence gathered for this review is current to September 2018. We found 19 randomised studies that compared antibiotics versus placebo in a total of 2663 COPD patients with a wide range of flare‐up severity. Key results Analyses show that currently used antibiotics reduced treatment failures (no improvement in symptoms, despite treatment, within 7 to 28 days, depending on the study) compared with placebo in outpatients with mild to moderate flare‐ups, as well as in patients admitted to an intensive care unit for very severe flare‐ups with respiratory failure. However, antibiotics did not reduce treatment failures among hospitalised patients with severe flare‐ups, although we are less certain about this result because the effect estimate also suggested findings similar to those seen in outpatients, but the confidence interval crossed 1.0. Use of antibiotics led to reduced mortality only in patients admitted to an intensive care unit, but not in patients with mild to moderate (outpatients) or severe (inpatients) flare‐ups, although deaths were rare in these latter groups. Antibiotics did not reduce length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients. Patients treated with antibiotics experienced diarrhoea more often than those given placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. Reviewers could not compare the severity of underlying COPD across trials because trial authors inconsistently reported lung function and other pa ameters. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence for review outcomes was low to moderate. Conclusion Although trial results show that antibiotics were effective across outcomes for patients with very severe flare‐ups and respiratory failure who needed treatment in an intensive care unit, researchers report inconsistent effects in patients with mild to severe flare‐ups. Future high‐quality studies should examine clinical signs or blood tests at the time of presentation that are useful for identifying patients who can benefit from antibiotic therapy.	10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	513	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
JOUR	[BLANK]	Carvedilol versus traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices	Zacharias APJ, R.  Hobolth, L.  Bendtsen, F.  Gluud, L. L.  Morgan, M. Y.	2018	CiteN	[NOT USED]	[NOT USED]		[EndPage]	Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews		[BLANK]	[BLANK]		[Bookitle]	[Editors]	Issue		John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[SciAbsLinks]	[UseFriendSumLinks]	[AMSTAR]	[Countries]		[Srsitle]	[SrsEds]	- Background Non‐selective beta‐blockers are recommended for the prevention of bleeding in people with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices. Carvedilol is a non‐selective beta‐blocker with additional intrinsic alpha 1 ‐blocking effects, which may be superior to traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers in reducing portal pressure and, therefore, in reducing the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of carvedilol compared with traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices. Search methods We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary's Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 08 May 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials comparing carvedilol versus traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers, irrespective of publication status, blinding, or language. We included trials evaluating both primary and secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and verified gastroesophageal varices. Data collection and analysis Three review authors (AZ, RJ and LH), independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events. We undertook meta‐analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I 2 values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary domains and the quality of the evidence with GRADE. Main results Eleven trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One trial did not report clinical outcomes. We included the remaining 10 randomised clinical trials, involving 810 participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices, in our analyses. The intervention comparisons were carvedilol versus propranolol (nine trials), or nadolol (one trial). Six trials were of short duration (mean 6 (range 1 to 12) weeks), while four were of longer duration (13.5 (6 to 30) months). Three trials evaluated primary prevention; three evaluated secondary prevention; while four evaluated both primary and secondary prevention. We classified all trials as at 'high risk of bias'. We gathered mortality data from seven trials involving 507 participants; no events occurred in four of these. Sixteen of 254 participants receiving carvedilol and 19 of 253 participants receiving propranolol or nadolol died (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.53; I 2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). There appeared to be no differences between carvedilol versus traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers and the risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.37; 810 participants; 10 trials; I 2 = 45%, very low‐quality evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42; 810 participants; 10 trials; I 2 = 14%, low‐quality evidence). Significantly more deaths, episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events occurred in the long‐term trials but there was not enough information to determine whether there were differences between carvedilol and traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers, by trial duration. There was also insufficient information to detect differences in the effects of these interventions in trials evaluating primary or secondary prevention. There appeared to be no differences in the risk of non‐serious adverse events between carvedilol versus its comparators (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.29; 596 participants; 6 trials; I 2 = 88%; very low‐quality evidence). Use of carvedilol was associated with a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers both in absolute (MD ‐1.75 mmHg, 95% CI ‐2.60 to ‐0.89; 368 participants; 6 trials; I 2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and percentage terms (MD ‐8. 2%, 95% CI ‐11.49% to ‐4.55%; 368 participants; 6 trials; I 2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). However, we did not observe a concomitant reduction in the number of participants who failed to achieve a sufficient haemodynamic response (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; 368 participants; 6 trials; I 2 = 42%; very low‐quality evidence) or in clinical outcomes. Authors' conclusions We found no clear beneficial or harmful effects of carvedilol versus traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers on mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, serious or non‐serious adverse events despite the fact that carvedilol was more effective at reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality, and hence the findings are uncertain. Additional evidence is required from adequately powered, long‐term, double‐blind, randomised clinical trials, which evaluate both clinical and haemodynamic outcomes. Plain language summary Is carvedilol more effective or safer than traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers for people with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices? Background Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver that results in an increase in its stiffness. As a result of the increased stiffness, the pressure in the blood vessels draining into the liver ‐ the portal system ‐ is increased. The increased portal blood pressure can result in the development of abnormally dilated blood vessels or varicose veins in the stomach and oesophagus (gastroesophageal varices). These varices can burst and the bleeding that follows can be life‐threatening. Drugs that reduce the portal blood pressure can help deflate the gastroesophageal varices and hence reduce the risk of bleeding. The drugs most commonly used are called non‐selective beta‐blockers. A newer drug, carvedilol, is also a beta blocker but has additional actions and may be more effective at reducing the portal pressure and hence the risk of variceal bleeding. Review question We investigated the effects and safety of carvedilol in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices by reviewing clinical trials in which people were randomly allocated to treatment with carvedilol or to a traditional beta‐blocker. Search date May 2018 Trial funding sources Two of the 11 randomised clinical trials included in the review received no funding or other support from pharmaceutical companies. Two did receive financial support from pharmaceutical companies while a further three received free supplies of the trial drugs. Four trials did not provide funding information. Trial characteristics We included 11 randomised clinical trials, but were only able to gather information for our analyses from 10 trials involving 810 participants. The length of treatment ranged from one week to 30 months. Key results Our analyses found no differences in the effects of carvedilol on the rates of death, bleeding or serious and non‐serious complications compared with traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers. Carvedilol lowered the portal pressure more effectively than the traditional, non‐selective beta‐blockers, but did not increase the number of participants in whom the pressure was reduced enough to reduce the risk of bleeding. Quality of the evidence We classified the evidence as of low or very low quality, so further trials are needed.	10.1002/14651858.CD011510.pub2	[Avail]	[Acc]	[Medium]	[BLANK]	503	[Address]	[Link]	[Attch]	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011510.pub2	[RelLinks]	[Imag]
